			'How would you go about proving that doesn\'t work? If you parents, grandparents told you something work and you have no framework taught to you in school to disprove that it doesn\'t work, how would you know it doesn\'t work?

Do you have access to some reports indicating modernity has reached the more rural areas of China?',
			'I don\'t really know that that\'s a valid argument at this point though. If you\'ve got enough money to afford rhino horn, you can\'t at the same time pretend that you don\'t have enough money to afford a basic education.',
			'First of all, most people aren\'t buying a full rhino\'s horn, or at least, they\'re not gonna be the only ones baring the brunt of the cost.  Second, that\'s making the (wildly inaccurate) assumption that a basic education is even available. People that sell rhino horns know where to go to sell them, but people in desperate need of an education often don\'t know where to go to get it.',
			'Us humans are really really good at confirmation bias.

You\'re seriously underestimating the staying power of ideas. Even if/when objectively false, they don\'t just \'go away\' naturally over time.',

			'"Flooding the market" with legal wildlife products (whether it\'s from regulated captive wildlife farming or synthetic substitutes) sounds like a good idea, but every time it\'s been tried, poaching gets worse. A few examples:  In 2008, CITES (the group that regulates international trade in wildlife) decided to allow a one-time, legal sale of 108 metric tons of stockpiled ivory to China, with the idea that flooding the Asian market with legal ivory would knock black-market poachers out of business. But the sale had the opposite effect: after the announcement, illegal ivory production shot up by over 60%, and the sale is often blamed as one of the factors that sparked the current elephant poaching crisis.  In China, it\'s legal to sell products made from captive-bred tigers as long as the breeding farm has a permit from the government. As a result, tiger "farms" can produce legal tiger products on an industrial scale. But despite having a large legal supply of captive tigers, the poaching of wild tigers has increased across Asia since the trade in captive tigers was made legal. Since South Africa legalized the international trade in captive-bred lion bones and trophies, park rangers have been finding the mutilated carcasses of poached wild lions much more frequently. There wasn\'t even a market for lion parts in Asia before 2007, when the lion farms were established.   There are several reasons why this happens. First of all, any government approval of the sale of wildlife products, synthetic or not, signals that these products have value, increasing demand. For example, the company that makes synthetic rhino horns is selling them as an aphrodisiac, which only confirms the myth that rhino horn can be used for such things. Secondly, legal markets provide traffickers with an easy way to launder illegally-poached wildlife as legal specimens. Paperwork can be forged, officials can be bribed, etc.  Finally, many consumers of wildlife products believe that products derived from captive animals are inferior to those from wild animals, either as a medical/spiritual remedy or as a status symbol. If you\'re rich, you flaunt diamonds, not cubic zirconia. So a glut of legal, captive-bred wildlife products only increases the value and demand for "authentic", poached products. This is why the majority of reputable conservation groups (WWF, Panthera, etc.) advocate for complete bans on all wildlife products, including captive-origin or "synthetic" substitutes. Zero tolerance is the only thing that\'s worked.',
			'I think the difference is that the legality of selling rhino horns was never to be changed. So essentially, the idea was that they would be making it extremely difficult for buyers to know if they were buying the real deal or not, which hopefully would make buyers less willing to pay big prices, etc. Then again, if you\'re gullible enough to think there\'s some magic in rhino horns, you\'re definitely gullible enough to think that a vendor is telling the truth when he says he can decipher between real and fake ones. So who knows. I remember seeing something about it but don\'t know if it ever actually was done or was even doable.',
			'What if you flooded the black market with synthetic elephant tusks? As in, hid the fact it\'s synthetic and introduced it through an intermediary in the crime syndicate? Edit. Obviously a government couldn\'t do this. But maybe find a poacher who wants to change his ways, but needs the money. Recruit him, set up your 3d printers and go. A) you\'d make bank, since you would price your stuff at the same price but, presumably you\'d be able to manufacture it super cheap. B) you\'d save lions by not killing them and flooding the market.',

Flooding the market does not help.',
			'I read it. All of his examples were of attempts to flood the market that were both legal and public. According to his own words it was the publicity and inherant government acceptance of the items value that lead to the upsurge in poaching. It\'s like you didn\'t even read my post. I\'m taking about a covert market flood. This bypasses the above stated flaws of using this strategy.',
			'Yeah they aren\'t understanding at all... There\'s a massive difference between flooding a market with real product compared to synthetic.',
			'Throw in some cocaine and a coup and you might get the CIA\'s attention. ',
			'Exactly what I was thinking.',
			'As something I have been wondering about, I wonder if the same/a similar thing would/does happen with introducing a legal market for certain drugs. Many proponents of drug legalization believe that having a legal market would destroy the black market, much like I would expect to have happened with wildlife product markets. But you have refuted this for wildlife products. I wonder how different drug markets are, and if we see more or less of the same factors.',
			'This reminds me of going to the Singapore zoo in 2008. They had a display about tiger poaching and how endangered they are... and then were selling tiger balm in the gift store. Yes yes, I know tiger balm doesn\'t have anything from actual tigers in it, but that\'s not the point. Legitimate places like the national zoo selling something with "tiger" in the name that is meant to have medical benefits it does a lot to propagate the myth. ',

			'Pretty sure Chinese legislation doesn\'t necessarily affect Hong Kong. I think China voted to ban it, and now HK followed up on it too.',
			'That\'s correct - people were mentioning when that ban went through that HK needed to do it separately. ',
			'that\'s why I said "and/or"',
			'Sure, but I\'m just saying the reason it might seem like you hear about it so often is because these 2 pieces of legislation happened pretty close to each other.',
			'Just like with Rhino, this will cause an increase in the slaughter of Elephants for tusks. My making it illegal to buy will drive the price up on the black market. Making it more lucrative for those that poach. Not sure what the solution is to stop it outright but at least they made it 1.3 million fine and 10 years in prison. ',
			'I would think making horns and ivory less available would drive the price up, regardless of how they do it. Not sure how they could fix things unless they breed rhinos and elephants (not with each other) to sell the ivory and horns, but that hardly seems practical since they\'re not exactly livestock.',
			'When I was I the navy I went to Hong Kong, and went into this very nice ivory shop. The centerpiece of the store was this 1.5 million USD ivory dragon suspended from the ceiling. Neat stuff but horrible how they attain it, they assured me it was from mammoth tusks dig up in Russia, but I didn’t buy it',
			'Well of course you didn\'t buy it. Not many people in the Navy can afford 1.5 Million USD. ',
			'Darknet market is gonna blow up probably. ',

			'Posting this reply I wrote here because I think it might be helpful for all parties. I’m not trying to make anyone feel bad, but I would like to draw attention to the sexual benefits of being uncircumcised.  First things first: uncircumcised men don’t have “extra” sensitivity, circumcised men have less sensitivity. This lack of sensitivity causes two (albeit closely related) things:   Less pleasure overall. This means that you might go faster or harder in order to reach the same level of pleasure that uncircumcised men can reach more easily. This can make it harder to maintain that “sweet spot”, where it feels good, but you’re still in control of your own orgasm. The result can often be premature ejaculation.  Less range of pleasurable feeling. As all sexually active men know, the way sex feels changes depending on how long your penis is stimulated. A lack of sensitivity can make it difficult to notice this change on a small scale, often resulting in becoming too stimulated before you have time to slow down and get a feel for how ‘close’ you are.   Have you considered that you might just have an unfulfilling sex life? Sex can be a long activity, if you and your partner are willing and able to communicate.

And directing the homeless to those better places would require having people do that work, etc. I imagine someone on the council just getting pissed about people continually bitching about not being able to ever find a bench because people were sleeping on them and then did the cheapest thing they could think of to get their phone to stop ringing.',

But if it is, are resources better spent in this town or is the homeless situation for drastic/dire somewhere else? What resources are necessary to address it and are they available?

You still see more men in shelters because women find other alternatives. Most homeless women victims of domestic or sexual violence, so they’d rather stay somewhere away from men. ',

			'This is most correct.

			'Yea, in the US the homeless I\'ve made friends with or speak to hate going to shelters because they have to watch their stuff (pay more attention to ensure their stuff isn\'t taken than they do on the street) or risk getting it stolen. Especially disabled or blind homeless avoid the shelters, because the few I\'ve spoken to say they are constant targets by others who think they are weaker and easier to steal from. ',

			'It\'s a rough situation with no real right answer. They\'re not hurting anyone so should they really lose their freedom and be detained in an institution? Especially a mental health institution which is notoriously subpar? While it might be a solution, the drawback is that it\'s expensive for taxpayers and the guy would probably much rather be out on the streets or in a group home. But at the same time usually these are the guys who can\'t function in a group home. Often the best course is just to let them be and make sure they have access to meal centres, but even then it\'s just a partial solution. How to help the homeless (cheaply, no municipality wants to spend a dollar more than they have to on people who don\'t contribute to the local economy) is a really tough issue - there\'s entire specialized degrees on various answers to the homeless question EDIT: Not really sure what the guy below me is trying to say. Why would a municipality skim off the top of stocks and bonds? Rich people in rich houses pay significant property taxes, they contribute far more to the local economy than the homeless. I\'m all for eating the rich in general, but I don\'t think that really applies here',

			'This is in the UK though',
			'And even before then, said system was being exposed left and right for the inhumane treatments they were putting patients through. Many asylums closed for this reason (Letchworth Village comes to mind).',
			'And while the mental health system has made huuuuuuge strides since then, there\'s also the issue that a lot of people who are homeless don\'t have mental health issues and don\'t need that treatment - they need a place to stay and a job. Actually, providing those two things would probably help a lot of the homeless people who do have mental illness. Not having a home or job would certainly make me mentally ill.',
			'This is not a bad suggestion, but you should probably accept that there is a certain contingent that will never get on their feet. How do we handle those people? And should we "handle them" at all? I don\'t have the answer, but it\'s the real question.',
			'The parks should be kept safe even if we can\'t house the homeless though. The same way we should be treating people with drug addiction issues, but we shouldn\'t allow them to hang out in the parks and leave needles behind just because we haven\'t funded a treatment program for them yet. We need to do both things, but you don\'t have to wait to do one until you can do both.',
			'Even when there are adequate shelters, the homeless don\'t like to use them because there are too many rules, no drug use, no pets allowed. Also they get their stuff stolen because they are forced to live around other homeless and they HATE the homeless more than you and I do. ',
			'1000% this. Hundreds of shelter beds in California are empty each night.',
			'Shelters can be violent, you can be almost guaranteed to get your stuff stolen in many of them, sometimes they have fees or hourly restrictions you miss (have to be in before X and out by Y but you also had to get across town that day to try to apply for housing or wait in line for food), some are forcefully religious, etc. There are lots of very good reasons that shelter beds might be empty.',
			'They often outright turn away single men. edit: I am not an MRA, those guys below who are braying about patriarchy are assholes. All I am doing is pointing out why those beds may be empty. Many shelters prioritize women, women with kids, and families; with the myriad of problems facing the homeless community, it\'s a shitty choice that has to be made due to the prevalence of unstable mental health, drug and alcohol issues that can cause problems inside a shelter.',
			'So... they turn away the vast majority of homeless people?',
			'Yeah actually. I volunteered at a homeless shelter and they had a much nicer "apartment style" setup that you could move into for a month max and they were women and children only. Had open ones too but wouldn\'t setup a dude in one. ',
			'That\'s kind of fucked up. I can see why youd prioritize families over single people... but not women over men.. or single mothers over single fathers.',

			'But the ad said 1/4 homeless were women! /s',
			'Housing without a door that locks isn\'t real housing. Would you choose to live somewhere where you stand a good chance of getting robbed, stabbed, or raped every night? Shelters that provided warm, locking cubicles (however spartan) would be a much more "real" solution in terms or providing something resembling stability than what we do now.',
			'My city repurposed a former school building for homeless to sleep overnight. The immediate result: an significant increase in used needles and human feces in the nearby playground. Shelter isn\'t enough and are just a band-aid to make us feel good. Programs and a longer-term rehabilitation program are definitely needed. However, while we should do more it must be recognised that some people can\'t be helped - at least in terms of becoming regular\'ish positive citizens - and we need a strategy to separate and deal a with them from the general homeless population. Homelessness, addiction, mental illness, and criminality all often appear in similar circles but are in reality all different problems with no single solution for a given condition. Even there\'s could be divided into sub-categories, as some people recover more easily than others.',
			'That doesn\'t solve the problem, it just displaces it onto someone else.  These bars might make homeless people go elsewhere... and then those problems you complain about will happen wherever else they wind up. If you want to treat them like some walking malignancy, all you\'re doing is concentrating it onto other poorer areas that can\'t afford to build barriers to them. ',
			'ockquote> That doesn\'t solve the problem, it just displaces it onto someone else.  This is a fundamental problem with the way many issues are handled.  Take the problems with mass shootings in America. Schools get shot up? People say we should arm the teachers or put cops all over every school. Great... so now that schools are a secure location, the mass shooters will just go shoot up a day care. So we put armed guards at all day cares. Great... now the mass shooters will shoot up a mall... so we put arm guards at the mall.  The solution of hardening a target just means the problem (be it vagrants or gunmen) will move onto a softer target, but the underlying problem is never solved.',
			'Seems to me the biggest problem we have with school shootings is with kids that are actually going to the school and being mistreated. I don\'t think those kids necessarily want to go and just shoot something, IE going to a daycare to shoot babies. They go to shoot the people and the place where they feel they have been mistreated. Maybe a few people who are so insecure with yourselves that you need to pick on someone else were to stop picking on someone else and start picking them up we would have less shootings. Or we could just put up automatic sentry guns....',
			'Great analogy. Like what do you all want to arm everyone or actually figure out why this happens in the first place and fix that overall issue. ',
			'Looking deeper into those issues usually exposes systemic problems that important people usually like to keep covered up.',
			'It depends on the problem you\'re working to solve. If it\'s homelessness then no, it doesn\'t if it\'s keeping people from sleeping on benches, then, yes, it does.',
			'Oh I agree with you. My dad does a lot of farmers markets downtown and I\'ve heard some horror stories from him. That being said putting rails on benches is a bit of a "bandaid" solution and programs to get people out of poverty will help us in the long run. Hard to get politicians to think long term sometimes though.',
			'Just because someone implements a short term solution on proposed a small change it doesn\'t mean they aren\'t thinking of the long term. I see this argument a lot and it always bothers me. There isn\'t one thing that will fix homelessness. But there are a million things that will help. However, if every time someone does something small it\'s torn apart for not being something HUGE than nothing will get done at all. Salt Lake City, Utah has really been focusing a lot on their chronic homeless problem but every step has been met with a massive push back with people criticizing everything that the new programs DON\'T do. They\'re straight up giving homes to the homeless but people complained that basic needs and medical care is the REAL problem and not having a home is just a by-product of the REAL problem. They increased policing in high crime areas where homeless where overdosing and violent crime was out of control. People complained they were criminalizing homelessness. They added more shelters beds, increased availability to rehab, mental health support, job placement, and community support and people complained that all those are useless if they\'re not fixing the problem of WHY these people are homeless in the first place. Everything that has been done has been called a "band-aid". So yeah, sure. They\'re band-aids. But until we invent the "magic-problem-solver ray" they\'re what we\'ve got.',
			'It is obvious to me that a lot of homeless people would literally need a 24/7 babysitter in order to be okay. They would need a home, a daily housekeeper, a daily therapist, and a life coach to follow them around constantly. We used to put these people in an institution where they basically had all that stuff, but those went out of fashion. We simply do not have the resources to treat people who need this level of care. Society is designed for people who can take care of themselves to a certain extent. ',
			'I\'m not saying what I have here is the same everywhere, but I know in my area (Springfield, MO) there are TONS of resources for homeless people. They will even pay your rent at a place of YOUR choosing on top of all the other government aid. My girlfriend worked for a behavioral health place here helping people who are homeless or extremely poor, and the consensus was that 99% of the people who are there don\'t even try. Which is sad because all you have to do is say "hi i need help", so one can deduce that either A. they\'re not advertising well enough or B. it\'s easier to stand on the corner and beg for money. I\'d like to help anyone who needs it, but you can\'t help someone who won\'t help themselves.',
			'The Baltimore and Annapolis trail in MD use to tolerate homeless being nasty washing underwear out in water fountains. That was till a joggers were being sexually assaulted by the homeless and they found the body of a missing bicyclist that hadn\'t been seen for 3 years because some vagrant stabbed him and took his bike. Can\'t say I missed the days riding by a guy getting a blowjob in the open by the playground. How about instead of focusing on what we do to keep them from ruining recreation areas we focus on lack of solutions to get single males off the street. Bitching about a bar on a bench isn\'t caring either. That\'s just complaining about a shit solution being closed off that was cheap to the tax payer. ',
			'Haha damn, I grew up in the city and I remember one time going to glen burnie on a biking expedition with my friends family. We saw huge crowds of homeless right along the tracks and I remember at the time thinking wtf are all these bums doing on this bike trail. Was wondering what the name of that trail was. ',

			'Unpopular opinion. But when I\'m trying to wait for the bus, I\'d like to sit and not have to tell a bum I can\'t spare any cash. I\'d like to actually sit on the benches. I don\'t want my local park to turn into "Hobo Jungle". It sucks. I hate it. I wish there was something that could be done about it. But as it stands, I\'d much rather see these bars and spikes making it harder for hobos to "live" around the general population and sleeping in these public places. ',
			'I recently lived in Portland, Oregon and it\'s absolutely filled with tweakers and retired twenty-somethings just camped out on the sidewalks trying to scrape by on whatever they can steal (typically bicycles). Some of these people are also really aggressive and threatening and will assault passersby without any provocation. You can\'t walk half a block without being asked for a buck and it gets so old that after experiencing that for a few weeks I completely stopped acknowledging them, they might as well not exist in my eyes. Like don\'t you get it, you\'re the 12th person in the past four blocks that\'s asked me for money, why on earth would I help you when you don\'t even help yourself? Homelessness is a real problem that needs to be addressed on a national level in every country, but a lot of homeless people are also selfish assholes who will fuck your shit up every chance they get. So I support taxpayer funded efforts to reduce homelessness, but I\'ll never hand one of those fuckers a single cent.',
			'I live in Seattle and the homeless is the same here. I’ve been physically assaulted as well as had stuff thrown at me because I tell them I don’t have any money or cigarettes (I don’t even smoke cigarettes) to give them. I moved from NYC and thought I’ve seen homeless, but the west coast is something else.',
			'I agree with you. I lived in a major city for a year with my dog so I did a lot of walking outside. So much literal human shit and trash everywhere.  There was a street I wouldn\'t walk down because it was run down and had no running businesses for the most part which caused homeless people to set up camp in the overhanging doorways of would-be businesses.  They would ask for cash which is fine I guess it doesn\'t hurt to ask but sometimes when I said no they\'d challenge me or I would ignore them and I\'d get followed. If you give them money there\'s a chance that they will ask for more. If you gave them food they\'d be mad you didn\'t give them money because you can\'t get heroine with food. When you deal with people like this almost daily it\'s easy to lose sympathy for all of them when the ones who have no problem harassing you stand out so much',
			'This isn’t inhumane. The benches are there to be sat on enjoyed by people of the area. Not used as a bed for 8 hrs straight in the middle of the day. Plus, no one feels safe being at, shopping at, or going to a park that has homeless people sleeping around. Especially with your young kids. The risk is too high. So now you have public places that are unusable by those who paid for them. ',
			'I agree. Seems like there are a lot of people who have never dealt with the homeless before in this thread. The reality is that being homeless doesn\'t entitle you to monopolize public space. I deal with the homeless every day, and I absolutely support these measures. ',
			'Worked at a store that was:   Open late Had a safe in the backroom and a bathroom right next to it  Having homeless people literally threaten to shit on your floor if you don\'t let them use the bathroom that is right next to your safe full of money is a fairly un-fun experience that can lead to either a. allowing it and being fired or  b. allowing it and getting robbed or  c. allowing it only to discover that they wanted the washroom for non-washroom related activities or they were too high/drunk and missed the toilet or d. refusing and having the unspeakable near/in your store It was definitely much easier if I don\'t have to ever deal with those people again. Whether most people agree or not and/or think that\'s a cruel way of looking at things, it\'s not fair to private businesses etc. to have to deal with the homeless either. It\'s hardly surprising to me that people would go out of their way to design anti-homeless architecture/furniture if it means they don\'t have to ever deal with those situations. I think that\'s also one of the big reasons that a lot of stores (In Canada anyways) nowadays are moving away from being in malls that can be easily reached by foot-traffic to being only accessible by personal vehicle via highways: the belief being that only those with enough money to afford a car can actually go to those areas easily, hence businesses can completely avoid the issue of the homeless.',
			'Completely agree, so many armchair activists think the problem can be solved by just being nice and giving them stuff thinking it will solve the problem. Sad reality is most of these people don’t want to change their ways and kicking them somewhere out of sight is the real solution. ',
			'How’s that any different than those metal clips on concrete that stop skateboarders? Undesired action, built in deterrent. ',
			'I thought I was taking crazy pills, this isn\'t new whatsoever. Slanted bench seats, jagged gravel under overpasses, thorny bushes, water sprinklers, urine deflectors on the sides of buildings, that\'s just what comes to mind. There\'s always a strong reaction when the design is ugly, but when it looks nice there\'s no reaction at all. It\'s like people aren\'t upset about the homeless, they\'re upset they\'re reminded about the homeless.',
			'A lot of the comments in this thread are making an extremely complicated subject into something black and white.  Five years ago the public library I worked at redesigned their park with "defensive architecture" in mind. Which is essentially things like benches that don\'t encourage sleeping, well lit paths, full vision. We did this because of constant complains from parents and community members that they no longer felt safe in the park and they were right not to feel safe. There were constantly used needles, empty beer cans and people selling or using drugs in the park. It reached a point where the people using our park were negatively impacting community\'s perception of the library. ',
			'Right, and budgets are tight in local government. If I\'m presented with a problem of people creating an unsafe or unsanitary environment in a park I manage, and I\'m given a budget of $3000, I\'m not going to be solving my community\'s homelessness, mental health, and drug problems with that. If I\'m a property owner, such as for an apartment or office building, I have a responsibility to my tenants to take steps to make a safe environment. I\'ll still vote for individuals who will take steps to solve these problems, and will pay more in taxes to do it, but different individuals have different responsibilities and powers.',
			'Benches are for everyone though, not really meant to be taken over all day by someone who decides its their bed for the time being.',
			'Have you ever went to a park with a dozen or so benches/tables and have seen most of them taken by the homeless? Literally taken ALL day and night (if they aren\'t booted). The design of these benches/tables isn\'t necessarily about being available to stop a homeless person from laying down. It\'s to stop them from making it THEIR furniture and the center piece of THEIR living quarters. However much one cares or don\'t care about the homeless... you\'d be a liar or an idiot if you "didn\'t mind" that the nice park, in the nice neighbor, where you provide a nice life for your family is a homeless haven/camp. A very simple thing to approach the problem is designing furniture uncomfortable enough for people to call their home.',
			'Never knew these benches were meant for the homeless. '

But in this case, the article faithfully repeated what their source said in this report starting on page 45.

Depending on whether the final outcome of the renewables target is closer to the Councils position of 27% or that one of the European Parliament of 35%, the renewables share in the power sector will have to be half or two-thirds of power production. This is because in heat and transport not many additional renewable sources are to be found, and biofuels has been proven to be a wrong strategy. The decarbonisation of heat and transport will result in using more electricity in those sectors – either directly through electric vehicles and heat pumps or indirectly by using hydrogen and other synthetic fuels. Hence, as the cheapest renewable resources, wind and solar power will become the backbone of Europe\'s power system. By 2030, wind and solar power production could either double or triple compared to 2017, depending on the outcome of the negotiations.  It looks to be that the EU\'s current outlook specifically understands that they will be turning away from biofuels in favor of the standard renewables.',

			'It\'s a CONTHPIRATHY!',
			'It\'s a fact he made a statement. His statement turned out not to be fact. Media don\'t do their due diligence in researching things, and neither do people when just reading headlines or blindly believing media. Many news subreddits tend to perpetuate not only misleading news, but also selectively spread news with a political bias.  Edit: Dude made a statement that funding ended when he knew the decision hadn\'t been made yet. Media didn\'t corroborate statement with other FEMA sources and just ran it. If that doesn\'t show a failure of due diligence or if you disagree then fine. But that\'s lazy',
			'Government agency says "we\'re going to stop doing X" generally doesn\'t require any additional due diligence to run the story, especially when X is negative. You out of 1984?',
			'Edit 2: Here is literal proof of my claim below, from an article dated yesterday, Jan. 30 To my understanding, the reports yesterday were that FEMA was ending aid in areas where services and businesses had mostly resumed normal operations. FEMA still intended to serve in a limited capacity to help more rural PR regions that are still getting back on their feet. I think it was a situation where the headlines said one thing, but the contents of the article painted a much different picture.  In that respect, I can see where clickbait headlines mislead people, but it\'s still on the people to A.) actually read the articles and B.) critically think about a politicized issue for a change. Edit: I can see that point B is completely ignored ITT. The headlines were misleading because there were qualifiers to that statement within the article. It\'s okay to admit that there was more to the story than a headline. I mean we have proof that this information was put forth, so pretending it doesn\'t exist only perpetuates the notion that people in this sub are reactionary and don\'t read the articles.',
			'Nothing in that article indicates the headlines were misleading. They contain a direct quote from FEMA specifically substantiating them. That FEMA are now backtracking because it turns out that abandoning American citizens to die is actually kind of unpopular doesn\'t invalidate that.',
			'Okay, so when the headline says FEMA is stopping food shipments we should take that to mean that they are going to continue into the foreseeable future? Literally in the same article a spokesperson says they\'re prepared to restart shipping when necessary. Why include only one of the quotes?  Both quotes combined lessen the significance of the story. By only quoting the source saying that "aid shipments will stop" (because private operations are running again and able to provide these services), it creates a negative image. This is positive news that shows progress is being made with the rebuilding effort and this was all public information yesterday.',
			'That\'s such bullshit. If the spokesperson or director of an agency makes an official statement, that\'s all the research the media needs to do at that time. It\'s not the media\'s fault this administration performs a constant dance of forward and back, outright denying they said the things they said on record.',

			'The issues is not wether supermarkets and other food vendors are available or not. A large part of the population was rendered unemployed as several businesses were closed due both to the hurricane damage and the economic contraction that it created. If FEMA seizes to provide aid, these people will not be able to purchase food and supplies at the available vendors. Given the economic disaster in which the local government finds itself, it is unable to provide aid to these people. Note: Citizens have already been told not to expect any returns on their local taxes as the debt has to be paid before all other goverment funding (applicable only in US territories). Several municipalities will be shutting down indefinitely as of April which will again render thousands unemployed and without any possible government aid.  While I’m on the topic, Trump’s tax cuts will be adding a 20% tariff on goods imported from PR which produces some of the most affordable medical supplies in the US. This tariff will probably close down the pharmaceutical production sector in PR. In the short term, that means medical supplies in the US will be scarce and expensive while the production in the US scales to fit the demand. In the long term, a third wave of unemployed PR families will further exarcebate the dire economic situation. As the local government must pay the debt before funding public services, you can expect mass migrations towards the US East coast focusing on NY, PA and FL. ',

That said, it\'s not quite as bad as the poster above said -- That 20% tariff actually got removed and replaced with a 12.5% patent/innovation tax on patents or patent licenses held by Puerto Rican companies. It\'s still pretty bad, but a little less so.',
			'To be more specific:  The US has added a 12.5% tax rate for foreign corporations that bring goods into America. Essentially you get taxed 12.5% on the income you make from foreign made goods.  Because corporations in Puerto Rican do not pay the 21% American corporation tax rate, they are treated as foreign corporations, and the 12.5% tax rate is applicable to them. ',

			'A bit of your information on the tariffs may not be based on an older draft. All I could find about the latest draft said a 12.5% tax and not even on all goods. It only impacts US companies attempting to use PR as a tax dodge. I posted some excerpts and included known liberal sources.   "It could have been much worse, experts say. Republicans were initially pushing for a 20% tax that essentially would have been applied to goods made in Puerto Rico and sent to the mainland. That provision got thrown out. " The final draft calls for a 12.5% tax on any income generated from patents and licenses held by foreign companies outside the United States. Under U.S. tax codes, companies in Puerto Rico are treated as foreign corporations, even if their parent organization is located in the mainland United States and they employ U.S. citizens. Under previous law, companies in Puerto Rico paid no federal tax on patents or licenses. Companies may apply for things like patents at the federal level, but the taxes they pay are based on where a company or its subsidiary are physically located.   Source: http://money.cnn.com/2017/12/20/news/economy/puerto-rico-tax-bill/index.html  And Puerto Rico is treated like a foreign country when it comes to taxes. For most of its history, this unique status has been a benefit. Indeed, with Congress’ help, it has served as the backbone of Puerto Rico’s economic development since the 1950s. The best known of these incentives was “936,” named for the portion of the federal tax code in which it is codified. Beginning in the 1970s, it offered favorable tax advantages to companies operating in Puerto Rico. When the incentive ended in 2006, Puerto Rico entered a serious recession from which it has never recovered. In response to the loss of 936, Puerto Rico enacted its own legislation to generate revenue. Puerto Rico’s "Act 154" of 2010 was created by the island government as a temporary excise tax on Puerto Rican products and services purchased by their mainland parent corporations. The companies didn’t fight the new tax because for them, it’s a zero-sum game: They pay Puerto Rico’s treasury, then deduct that amount on their federal returns. This new income for Puerto Rico, however, comes at the direct expense of the federal Treasury: Money that would normally be paid to the U.S. government is paid to Puerto Rico instead. In 2016, the tax amounted to $2 billion in revenue, 20 percent of the island’s general fund income.   Source: https://www.thedailybeast.com/gops-tax-bill-would-be-worse-for-puerto-ricos-economy-than-hurricane-maria Here\'s some more info on Section 936, and why it was ramped down during Bill Clinton\'s administration because US companies were basing some operations in PR as a tax dodge:  In addition to section 936, the Puerto Rican corporate tax code gave significant incentives for U.S. corporations to locate subsidiaries on the island. Puerto Rican tax law allowed a subsidiary more the 80% owned by a foreign entity to deduct 100% of the dividends paid to its parent. As such, subsidiaries in Puerto Rico had no corporate income tax liability as long as their profits are distributed as dividends.

We really only communicate with animals when they do it on our terms.',
			'Maybe complex verbal communication, but humans understand communication from animals, especially dogs. Tail wags, pawing at the door, bringing a ball, pawing at a food dish, etc. ',

I’m convinced he is just trying to break me down, and it’s working. ',

			'"HUMAN I NEED FOOD!"  It\'s full "I MEANT I NEED A CLEANED POOP BOX" It\'s clean  "FUCK YOU" runs away Cats in a nutshell',
			'The animals we successfully communicated with (I mean primates, parrots) used no structured languages to begin with and we are closer to understanding e.g. dolphin\'s communication. It takes time and the funding for this kind of research is abysmally low.',
			'I know where this leads to.',
			'So true, and this is the reason why it has been 60+ years of research and yet still do not know the function of even a single call, apart, of course, from signature whistles and echolocation. Echolocation and hearing are two areas that got extensive research only because the Navy was interested. ',
			'Presumably in that scenario there would both be a lot more urgency to figure out how to communicate, and ideally also both parties would be working to make communication viable, which makes it a bit easier of an ask. Cats don\'t give a shit if you can communicate with them, they meow at you and you give them food, they hiss at you and scratch you and you stop touching them. That\'s all the communicating they need. If aliens show up, even if they\'re just there to enslave us, like cats, presumably communication makes things easier for them. ',
			'Sure but what if they communicate the way dolphins do but with a more formal language? Would we even be able decipher that? It is a big assumption that aliens would have vocal chords and a written language like humans but it could be something beyond our comprehension.',
			'I feel like written language is simply necessary if you\'re an advanced civilization.',
			'We assume that because we are the only advanced civilization that we know. Seems that way to me as well, but honestly we don\'t completely know that. What if there is an advanced species out there that never developed vision and only feels its surroundings with some kind of advanced echolocation. They couldn\'t have a written language.',
			'Unless they have the possibility to store language outside of their mind in any way then I doubt it\'d be possible for them to become an advanced civilization (especially not a space-faring one) - so in this case they could perhaps simply use recordings. But if they\'re ever going to invent something that\'s able to record sound waves without the use of written language, then individuals need to 1) live for a long time, 2) be very adamant about passing on all of their knowledge to their children, 3) have a really good memory, lol.',
			'That just requires you to expand what you mean by “written”.  For example they could use some sort of tactile writing (like braille) or audio recording (Maybe even as primitives they could drag a stick across the “writing” and discern meaning from the sound) It seems a fair assumption that they would have some way of recording and relating information before inventing space travel, though I suppose if they have some sort of telepathy and/or extremely long life spans oral only (or whatever) communication could work.',
			'Yea I know you are mostly right... I am expanding the possibilities of a concept of life that is so unlike ours that we currently can\'t comprehend it. ',
			'Right, but by our definitions “society” and “life” have certain requirements. For example, if things can’t communicate, or modify/react to their environment in a meaningful way, then they can’t really be considered a society.',
			'You are assuming that all advanced civilizations would have appendages like our hands and prehensile fingers to write things down. Speaking of dolphins, their communication is insanely complex. We do know that they posses at least 2 sound generating mechanisms that could work independently and simultaneously. It appears that right side phonic lip is involved in echolocation and pulsed sounds, the right one is involved in whistling. Two (maybe even 3, if larynx is indeed invoved too) sound producing mechanisms make their communication even more complex, since it greatly increases the sound combinations probabilities. There are just so many possibilities to convey information, modulation, source levels, combinations of sounds, sound that are produced simultaneously, etc. And then there are burst pulses, so complex, you can convey information in so many ways. ',
			'Well, your best shot depends on the fact that they presumably understand math at the very least, and so you\'d be able to communicate on those lines, even if it\'s a bit harder if they don\'t have a written language. The hard part is figuring out how they do communicate, whether it\'s electrical impulses, chemical scents, or sexy dance fighting, but from there it\'s doable. If they can figure out that we have vocal cords and written communication, then they might get there first. ',
			'This could be the reason why we have not cracked the code. This is a non-human communication system, 25 mln years in the making by creatures who rely on sounds in ways humans never will. We just can\'t figure out anything, like for example what is the smallest unit of information? Is there one? Is their communication iconic? What is being communicated? We look at their whistles with all modulation, steps, subharmonics and have no clue what it all means, if anything. But make no mistake, some information is being transmitted, we know that. The Bastian experiment with all its flaws was first to demonstrate it,and it has been replicated too. Some researchers are not entirely convinced, but it is definitely a very interesting area to explore.',
			'When watching blue planet II, the amount of communicating they did while traveling was immense. They definitely use it to coordinate in some sense. Other people are argueing with me that any alien that is able to travel here will have a language we can break the code on but I am super skeptical. Even a written language could be beyond anything we have ever known and could take lifetimes to crack.',
			'You don\'t sit down and figure out how to talk to an alien in person. You train your computers to understand their computers, and vice versa. Also, if the aliens visit us but never bother to learn how they could communicate with us by scanning our various communication waves, then they are being extremely obtuse and probably don\'t want to talk to us anyways.',
			'I guess we’re OK now if the aliens are actually whales. ',
			'vast majority of animals use body language to communicate or low frequencies that we need machines to hear and sometimes smell.  We can only understand vocals and body language after intensive studies, hell we only know what dogs want because we evolved along side them and they adapted ways of communication for us.  Same with human babies, we don\'t know what they want but we sometimes what certain cries mean.',

Suffice to say... potentially a very dangerous man. Canada would not take him back unless a military court ruled him guilty with him admitting a guilty plea. He would them be shipped off to Canadian maximum security until they can decide whether or not he is a threat to society. He was released six months later with a bracelet and after six more months there were no restrictions on him. But a lot of countries were wanting money to take their citizens back.

While in CIA custody, he was flown to Afghanistan, where he was held at a black site and routinely interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomized, and subjected to other cruel forms of inhumane and degrading treatment and torture. After El-Masri held hunger strikes, and was detained for four months in the "Salt Pit," the CIA finally admitted his arrest and torture were a mistake and released him. He is believed to be among an estimated 3,000 detainees whom the CIA has abducted from 2001–2005. In May 2004, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Daniel R. Coats, convinced the German interior minister, Otto Schily, not to press charges or to reveal the program. El-Masri filed suit against the CIA for his arrest, extraordinary rendition and torture. In 2006, his suit El Masri v. Tenet, in which he was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, based on the U.S. government\'s claiming the state secrets privilege. The ACLU said the Bush administration attempted to shield its abuses by invoking this privilege. The case was also dismissed by the Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit, and in December 2007, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On December 13, 2012, El-Masri won an Article 34 case at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The court determined he had been tortured while held by CIA agents and ruled that Macedonia was responsible for abusing him while in the country, and knowingly transferring him to the CIA when torture was a possibility. It awarded him compensation. This marked the first time that CIA activities against detainees was legally declared as torture. The European Court condemned nations for collaborating with the United States in these secret programs. [...] After his release, in 2006 El-Masri wrote in the Los Angeles Times that, while held by the CIA in Afghanistan, he was beaten and repeatedly interrogated. He also said that his custodians forcibly inserted an object into his anus. He was kept in a bare, squalid cell, given only meager rations to eat and putrid water to drink. ',

			'If you want an actual answer you\'re going to need to understand it from the point of view of the other side. They genuinely feel that some, most, maybe even all of the people who are there actually do have links to terrorism. That they are legitimately a threat. So start with that assumption. I know that you and I disagree with that, but to understand this you\'re going to need to start from that point of view. Now with that assumption in mind, closing this base would mean you have only a few choices... First, you could move them to prisons in the United States. The problem with this is that we are a nation of laws that would require there to be evidence. Evidence that you may not be able to provide to the extent that are Law requires it. Again it\'s very tempting here to just wave this away and say "well if they don\'t have evidence then they should let them go"... If you\'re genuinely trying to understand this mindset, don\'t fall back to this. They genuinely do believe that the people involved are guilty, there just may not be enough evidence to conclusively prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. As such, moving them to the US isn\'t an option. As an alternative you could move them to countries that have different laws and will keep them in prison on your behalf. However as this is a hot-button issue not many countries are lining up to do us a favor. Finally, you could just release them... But again, go back to that original assumption. Imagine that you had captured all of the hijackers from 9/11 before their attack, you are one hundred percent positive that these people were going to kill countless Americans and you understood the full scope of their plan.... Only you can\'t prove it. If it helps to picture this, imagine you went back in time and literally knew the future, you knew these were literally the people who performed the terrorist attack that you watched happen, but since you prevented it from happening you can\'t prove it. It would be very difficult for you to concede that you should release them. ... The key to this is genuinely believing these people\'s guilt. And honestly, there are probably many/some of them there who genuinely do have links to terrorism. And that\'s where we end up with the complication. How many terrorists would we let go to avoid having free people locked up? Again, my 9/11 from the future example is over the top but that serves as a tangible example because real terrorist attacks are real threats.  There were 19 hijackers on 9/11. If I sent you back to the year 2000 with a list of 40 names, would you put them all in prison to avoid the attack happening?  This is more than mined set of the people involved. And helps explain why it is more of the gray area without a simple answer. I know where I personally stand on the issue, but understanding the other viewpoints from their own place of logic is important. ...

In regions where women are forced to wear this, it is in essence an oppressive garment that serves the very system that western women and some eastern are trying to flee while seeking their own autonomy and independence from the traditionalist shackles rooted in religion and dogma. Wear it if you want but no woman should be hurt or killed for wanting to show a little or a lot of extra skin.',
			'But I would say that laws against Islamic dress, in France, Italy and Spain for instance, are just as ridiculous as laws mandating that dress in Iran.',
			'Well they wouldn\'t have outright banned it if people weren\'t trying to wear them in identification photos and refuse to be identified by authorities by keeping them on. ',
			'That\'s totally contradicting though. Then ban it from being worn when they need to not wear it. Why in the world does it require a ban all together',
			'How is that contradicting? People refused to comply when it was appropriate so they banned them totally. They were nicely asked to comply with Photo ID (where it\'s kind of important to see someone\'s features. You know, to identify them) and they also tried to refuse to remove the garments to be identified for other purposes. ',
			'Maybe contradicting is the wrong word. My point is that you dint ban sugar, if you don\'t want people to eat gummy bears. If it\'s a problem, then ban the problem (which is already banned).

Do you ban fotballs? Fuck no! Do you ban people from taking fotballs to places they shouldn\'t? Bingo bardo, retardo! You see, that\'s actually aiming at solving the problem. Banning footballs just create a whole nother problem, while not doing anything about the first one, because it was already illegal to have fotballs at passport photos. So to translate the metaphor: if you have a problem about people refusing to take their headscarves off at passport photos (which is already illegal), then you have a problem about enforcing you laws!

If it is believed that foreign agents are planting these ideas in the activists, then it gives the establishment all the ammunition they need to discredit the whole movement and reaffirm their own position. The resistance to foreign intervention is that strong, and even well-meaning foreign activists can do a great disservice to the efforts of actual locals to improve their communities. It\'s been documented in everything from efforts to curb FGM all the way to vaccination programs. Just look here at the US\' reaction to allegations of Russian interference in the election. We don\'t even have a history of getting oppressed, and the backlash has been fierce. How much more can we expect this in places that occupy weaker positions in the international community? And sure, it would be nice if everyone thought logically and empathetically and jsut listened to reason, no matter where it came from, but how many people in your own country are like that? We must always expect these things to be a struggle, let us not make them that much harder on the people actually suffering. Let\'s not deny them the opportunities to build up their own political clout and organizational power.

			'The hijab is only a requirement when you are living under the absolute rule of sharia law. What is Sharia? Well, there\'s not enough material in the Quran alone for a muslim to practice the 5 pillars. But there are 91 verses in the Quran that says that every human being is to follow a perfect pattern of the life of muhammad, and the life of Muhammad is found in the Sira, his biography, and the hadiths, his traditions. Sharia is the laws of the muslim world which are condensed from these 3 sources, Quran, Sira, and hadith. So why do I have a problem with it? Well Shariah isn\'t just like Jewish law, which is just for jews, or catholic law, which is just for catholics. Sharia claims it is the only law that all of mankind should follow, and it has very specific laws pertaining to me and you, the kafir. If the country you lived it became muslim majority, the laws would be replaced with Sharia, as it has in many countries. We would be dhimmis, or second class citizens, and would need to pay the tax to be allowed to exist, or face prosecution or even death if we refused. The hijab is a symbol that the woman wearing it is totally committed to Sharia. It\'s a symbol that tells me that the woman wearing it regards me as a kafir, an infidel. It\'s a symbol of the oppression of islam and jihad.',
			'Wow, that was honestly a pretty cool response, I never really got Shariah law, but on that last part, my perspective would be it\'s more of a symbol of Mom and Dad told me to wear it out, so I gotta, not a symbol that says, "I\'m better than you, ya godamn Kafir." That\'s cuz i see a bunch of muslim girls at the community college here in Minnesota. They don\'t seem judgemental, the ones I interacted with are actually pretty sweet, and generally shy.',
			'In general, women aren\'t the problem. It\'s almost always men involved in terrorism, war, and oppression--keeping the women "sweet" and "shy" is a big part of that.',

			'Women cannot go outside without covering themselves. Some places are less dogmatic and they allow a woman to show her face, her hands, or her ankles. The Hijab is not historical, its not for safety, its not for function. It is a religious symbol so that a woman can only be seen fully by the person that owns them, either their father or their husband. Its genuinely a mark of indentured servitude that they can\'t pay their way out of. Not all that far from a literal shackle or collar. These people are forced to wear this. I wouldn\'t compare it to the Swastika armband, but I\'d compare it to the Yellow Star.',

It can help with labour shortages, in the UK our building trade was helped by Polish workers and much of our aftercare for health is done by migrants.  It helps with temp jobs, for example if there was a labour shortage of a seasonal job like the tourist industry workers are free to fill those jobs and then return home. This is somewhat common in the UK among wait staff and other kitchen workers, I am assuming its used more than that but I am not an expert.  It allows countries to fill jobs quickly that would require long term training. Say we have a nursing shortage (which we fuckin will post Brexit) rather than wait for years to train nurses migrant workers can fill those roles.  Some countries labour force wont do undesirable jobs, bit like some jobs filled my Mexican/Latin Americans in the States.  The further west you go in the Europe the larger problem we have with an aging population and a low birth rate. Free movement has and will help that.  Something a bit harder to tie to a monetary or workforce gain is that free movement of people in theory lets us travel amongst our brothers and sisters, you are less likely to go to war or support a war with a country you have worked in and met the people.  Obviously there are flaws and problems with free movement, and honestly terror is not in my top 3. ',

Then, after grade 12, almost all Jewish Israelis join the Israeli military for 2-4 years, while very few Palestinian Israelis join. There, in addition to continuing segregation, they are also indoctrinated to see ethnic Palestinians as the enemies of Israel, whose motivations and intentions are subject to constant question and suspicion. While that indoctrination may be important for the roles they will play in the military -- enforcing a 50+ year belligerent military occupation over millions of people who are denied Israeli citizenship based on their ethnicity -- it further compounds the impunity Israelis feel in their dealing with Palestinians. Essentially, young, Jewish Israelis have been purposefully trained for generations to see Palestinians as the "other", the enemy, less than human (or at least less than a Jewish human).

			'Oh I know I am getting screwed. Between me and my employer it costs ~$1900 a month for my families health insurance. My part is almost $800 of that. Yes it is pretty good insurance coverage ONCE I MEET THE DEDUCTIBLE that went up (X2) due to the ACA (the minimum deductible rule). It is also great that as a sterilized male I am forced to still pay for insurance that provides maternity coverage. (something I should never need again) In fact maternity care is one of many unwanted insurance covered procedures in my plan. In my opinion what needs to happen is for insurance to be for catastrophic events (heart transplant, cancer, etc.) and go back to cash payments for most medical needs. I do not use my car insurance to cover my oil changes. Why do I use my health insurance for a simple checkup/minor illness/injury? There are doctors in the US who will cover all those "family doctor" stuff for a small monthly flat fee. (One near me is about $10 per an adult per month) If we were allowed to purchase only catastrophic insurance and use a doctor as mentioned above then everyone wins.(catastrophic insurance was relatively affordable until it was banned) However there is no longer just catastrophic insurance as they all have to meet the minimum requirements of the ACA, and that list is very expensive and expansive.  I would like to humbly disagree with your point about better. The wait times (NHS) for non-life threatening procedures continue to increase and far exceed any wait times in the US. Now maybe it is OK to make grandma wait weeks or months for a new hip, we can just medicate the hell out of her so she doesn\'t fell the pain.  If you want to see what the USA equivalent would be look no further that the VA. When engorgement runs anything they tend to mess it up.',
			'There are a number of things I\'d like to clear up from your post. First, not sure what you think the minimum deductible rule is, other than the deductible for an individual has to be lower than the overall family deductible in plans now. Why do you think that made them double?  It is also great that as a sterilized male I am forced to still pay for insurance that provides maternity coverage.  Unless all the women in your family are also sterile, that would be why there\'s still coverage.  I do not use my car insurance to cover my oil changes. Why do I use my health insurance for a simple checkup/minor illness/injury?  Preventative maintenance happens more often when it\'s covered. If your car breaks down that\'s your problem. Auto shops aren\'t legally required to fix your car.  If you end up in an Emergency room with a life threatening problem, the hospital has to treat you, they can\'t turn you away. Now your bills are someone else\'s problem. So in that context, having health insurance cover preventative medical makes a lot of sense. (unless you\'re OK with hospitals just letting people die who don\'t have proper insurance, then the car analogy works a bit better.)  There are doctors in the US who will cover all those "family doctor" stuff for a small monthly flat fee.  I have never heard of this outside of Govt. funded programs for low income citizens. If you have details on any of those $10 programs though I\'d love to read up on them. We have clients I\'d def. send to something like that if they\'re around.  If we were allowed to purchase only catastrophic insurance and use a doctor as mentioned above then everyone wins. However there is no longer just catastrophic insurance as they all have to meet the minimum requirements of the ACA, and that list is very expensive and expansive.  You still can, as long as you\'re under 30, or you meet specific exemptions. https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/  I would like to humbly disagree with your point about better.  Better if you\'re looking at actual outcomes. Aside from some crazy expensive cancer treatments, the vast majority of major metrics by which health outcomes are measured, the US system stinks compared to single payer systems. Pick a metric and we can look at some if you want specifics.  The wait times (NHS) for non-life threatening procedures continue to increase and far exceed any wait times in the US.  Are you referring to the 30 day delay they put into place due to the flu season? Or something more permanent than that? I know the NHS has had waiting times up there for a year or two now, but the NHS is still treating the same numbers as in the past, they just have more people to treat.  NHS funding has been increasing at a lower rate than the population has been increasing, and it\'s causing backlogs. If funding had kept pace with population growth, there wouldn\'t be the delays. This is an interesting graph showing medical spending as a % of GDP, and you can see that the US is horrible compared to EVERY other country. https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/media_large/public/media/change-in-total-health-spened-as-a-proportion-of-gdp.jpg?itok=EZwjvbth taken from here: https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/blog/2015/10/nhs-spending-squeezed-never',

This is rule in place to prevent countries from subsidizing domestic industry to intentionally destroy another countries market.

Or we can impose tariffs that combined with a low tax rate, as other have mentioned, to encourage companies to build them here. I’m all for the option that supports American companies / jobs.

Except now oil is more expensive. Shipping costs rise. Amazon can\'t afford to offer free shipping any more, so now less people buy from Amazon. They have to let a lot of workers go. Prices in the local supermarket rise because of the increased shipping costs. You\'re also spending more on fuel to get to work, so you have less disposable income. Less disposable income + higher food prices = your kids don\'t get all their nutrition needs fulfilled. Airlines are spending so much money on fuel that ticket prices rise. Now less people travel. So they have to fire some of their pilots and air crew. Mechanics get laid off. They can\'t afford to expand, so Boeing has to lay off their engineers because nobody is buying their planes.

The article\'s behind a paywall*, but it effectively says nations should introduce a global carbon price, then slap tariffs on any nation that refuses to join, and that Trump\'s behaviour is a good enough excuse to implement this plan. Put a carbon tariff on your own domestic goods, and also any that come in from outside. Historically, China would have been hit hard by such tariffs, but its desire to clean up its air has changed all that. The article (which was published in March 2017) suggests that the EU and China could be poised to band together to implement such a strategy. In doing so, such nations can claim a moral victory against Trump\'s US whilst hitting him hard. * EDIT: Not the Reuters one, the NewScientist one I\'m linking to.',
			'I 100% agree with this. Makes sense given the US is the only nation to not jump onboard Paris Accord',
			'ockquote> The article\'s behind a paywall*  I created a login and could read it. According to this, nations are taxed by how much carbon they use to produce things. How would be able to verify this? China isn\'t really known for being forthright in these types of things.  If someone vandalised your house, you’d be outraged if they got away scot-free. The idea of a carbon price is to make polluters pay for the damage their emissions will do to people’s homes and livelihoods, as a result of climate-change related floods, storms and sea level rise. One approach is to tax goods and services on the basis of how much carbon dioxide is emitted during their production – a carbon tax. The other is to impose a limit on how much CO2 can be emitted by large industries, and then sell permits to pollute – cap and trade, or carbon trading. We already know that a high-enough carbon price discourages fossil fuel use, encourages energy efficiency and makes renewables more competitive. To be really effective, the carbon price just needs to rise rapidly. ',
			'Can\'t we make our own solar panels?',
			'We can make our own everything. At 5 times the cost.',
			'I\'m sure you\'re exaggerating, but they do make them cheaper in Taiwan. How can they make them so cheap?',
			'It\'s a little exaggerated, but they can afford to make them cheaper for several reasons. First is the cost of living, which depending on the cities being compared can range from being 60% down to even 10% of what it is here in the US. Thus $3/hr wage in Taiwan could in many cases provide the same quality of life as $10/hr wage here in the US. Taiwan also has a lot more tech manufacturing than the US which means silicon prices are more competitive and thus lower there than they are here. Solar panels use the same or similar monocrystalline silicon that are used in CPUs, so being in close proximity to multiple companies that manufacture it gives you a negotiation advantage. Also, don\'t forget about the shipping costs involved in manufacture. Here in the US, the steel may be made in Michigan, silicon in Southern California, cabling in Pennsylvania, glass in Alabama, and final assembly in New Jersey. This is a lot of material that has to be safely shipped across a continent. Taiwan is much smaller with cities that specialize in manufacturing, so shipping is often shorter between nearby cities if not within the same city. So if we wanted to compete with China/Taiwan/South Korea on manufacturing, what would we have to do? Well, first would be to centralize the manufacturing and processing in the US. Once the raw materials reach a central location, moving it through each step becomes cheaper. Deciding where to place this would be a political nightmare as it would give the winning state huge economic boosts. It would turn states against each other. Now once the costs have been cut by centralizing manufacture, you need to cut wages. Of course for this to work, the cost of living needs dropped. Products, utilities, food, real estate, education, etc. would have to be offered at much lower prices for those who work in this zone than for those outside. The downside: this would probably cause a black market which means higher crime. In addition, centralizing industry to a single area is a giant target to protect for national security/defense.',
			'They obviously make them significantly cheaper, but that isn\'t the problem. The problem is that those cheap solar panels help employ thousands of installers. Naturally, if the price of the product goes up, less people tend to purchase it, resulting in a shrinking demand for repair and installation.',
			'I find it funny that an American must pay compensation for the potential loss of employment for citizens in another country. Seems legit fair.',
			'I\'m not really understanding your comment. Due to the tariff, American consumers will pay more for the product and its servicing while the number of Americans employed by the industry will decrease. The tariff adds about 1000 jobs in America and loses about 30000 jobs in American, the net difference being America loses 29,000 jobs due to the tariff. It was always a lose/lose. As part of the WTO, there are rules per the membership that even America has to follow.',
			'India did this and got sued.',
			'It takes a few years to build a factory. At which point, the tariff phases out. This is basically a fake attempt to fuck the solar industry and play to his base. In reality, it have very little effect on the solar industry as a whole.  It\'s much like the immigration ban. Make it look like he\'s doing something while he\'s really just masturbating and golfing most of the time.',
			'When will American consumers understand that duties protect industry, not consumers? Duties allow American companies to charge American consumers more for a given product because that\'s are no cheap, foreign alternatives. The higher profit won\'t be used to pay American workers more. It will be used to make rich people richer. On softwood lumber, Canadian mills have never been more profitable. Not a single mill worker has been laid off in Canada. The only result of the ridiculous US tartif is that Americans are paying 20% more for lumber and fewer people can afford to buy a home as a result. Trump isn\'t protecting Americans. He\'s enriching the wealthy. EDIT: My phone words badly. ',

			'You’re not wrong, protectionism between the two countries is stupid. The economies are so integrated it hurts both populations when they have these trade disputes.',

It has been co-opted by the middle men driving the price paid to the farmer down and the price paid by the consumer up. The same thing had happened in the US. We need a complete overhaul of both systems to the benefit of the farmer and the consumer. ',
			'Protecting industry is far more important than protecting the customers are different stages of the market.  What happens if we allow cheap solar panels to flood our market and put US manufacturers out of business. Then when solar is a significant portion of our energy generation and we have no significant local manufacturing capability, foreign governments suddenly decide the prices of panels have doubled. What do you suggest we do then? Running a business isn\'t just about cash. Its about protecting all your assets and nurturing new ones, at the expense of the competition if it comes down to it. ',
			'Just sell them to us instead in the eu. We need as many as we can get. Of course, we\'ll need sunshine too',
			'EU has solar tariffs similar to this one too. ',
			'Interesting that no-one freaked out when obama did the same thing, in addition to starting his government-funded solyndra to stomp out competition.',
			'Solyndra was essentially a “response” to China. The reason Obama and Trump want sanctions on Solar is because China subsidizes its solar industry, allowing companies to sell at cost. Solyndra was an attempt to nurture a viable alternative to imported Chinese tech that wouldn’t unduly harm consumers. It wasn’t a way to “stomp out” competition, it was a way to encourage people to buy U.S. panels instead.',
			'ockquote> China subsidizes its solar industry  Exactly in the same manner does US also subsidize industries making competition impossible, so it is business as usual.  It wasn’t a way to “stomp out” competition, it was a way to encourage people to buy U.S. panels instead.  EXACTLY why Trump continued with same tariff method as obama. But unlike obama he wants to allow free market competition, not picking a winner run by his friends.',
			'Then he should just subsidize all US solar companies, instead. I do agree subsidizing a single company is wrong, as it causes an imbalance in the market. But using tariffs and then not subsidizing the industry would do nothing except harm US consumers.',
			'It benefits all US companies. Subsidizing is wrong, tariff is much better method.',
			'Except it doesn’t. They’d be able to sell to US consumers, sure. That’s about 20% of the world market. Meanwhile, cheaper Chinese versions dominate the other 80%. There’s a reason the US Dollar is depreciating in value while other currencies (such as the Euro) are not. Isolationist trade policies (such as this one) serve to weaken the US economy, just as they weaken every economy that adopts them. On the surface they appear benign, even beneficiary to a country. In the end they only serve to reduce trade, tourism, and buying power. There’s a reason sanctions on exports are so effective, it essentially stops the country from being able to trade and chokes out its economy. Tariffs serve a similar purpose, in reverse. Placing tariffs on goods will hurt the Chinese companies in the short-term, but to truly be competitive the US would need to subsidize its industry. Considering everything the US already subsidizes (oil and gas, coal, timber, agriculture, silicon, etc) this wouldn’t be out of the ordinary.',

To summarize, domestic manufacturers won\'t be able to meet demand within the foreseeable future, and there\'s still no financial incentive for foreign manufacturers to establish new operations in USA, and that in turn will negatively affect jobs because manufacturing operations are largely automated, and due to reduced foreign supply installers and related-jobs will suffer with a lower supply on hand.',

However, his actions risk marking the US as a fickle and unreliable negotiating partner. The reason why these countries are bringing this up is because it disrupts the negotiated balance of these agreements. US companies benefit greatly from tariff-free markets, but to deny that to partners is exploitative. Free trade on the whole is massively beneficial to the US. Tearing down specific instances where others benefit makes the trade no longer free and is something we have successfully argued in the WTO many times before. The Obama administration was very skilled at this trade bureaucracy litigation. My worry is that Trump\'s boisterous and narcissistic nature will not help in these types of tactful processes.',

			'The idea here is that China is subsidising the solar panels they build, meaning they can sell them below cost. That\'s a competitive advantage no US company has. Because the Chinese panels are so cheap, people will buy those and US companies will bankrupt. That\'s not beneficial to the US. It\'s good for customers in the short run, but once the Chinese get that monopoly they can increase the prices again. Trump is probably doing this to protect the coal industry, which is stupid. But the tariffs themselves I can understand. The other idea is to very heavily subsidise US companies, which may be better but is also very expensive.',
			'Let them subsidise. If the Chinese taxpayer is paying for your energy, you are better off. Monopolies can only be sustained by continuous government intervention.

			'ockquote> That\'s not beneficial to the US.  That depends. If China is "unfairly" investing in solar panels, why is the US even competing in that particular field? Renewables is a vaste enterprise, with many different possibilities. If China is kicking the US into the dirt in terms of solar panels, why doggedly remain on that path, when they could invest more in wind, hydrogen, nuclear, wave, etc...? It makes no sense, from a business point of view.  What\'s more, the EU produces a fair quantity of solar panels, but instead of relying on quantity and price, they are selling quality. Not everything has to be the cheapest for the lowest denominator. You can make an absolutely shitton of money, and own a ridiculous market share, by offering higher quality, more technical goods for other applications.  It\'s good for customers in the short run, but once the Chinese get that monopoly they can increase the prices again.  Why would they increase the prices? Like I said above, China isn\'t the only country making solar panels, and its key value is not the quality of its product, but the cheap cost. If it increases the cost, it looses its market edge, and then ends up being a less reliable version of a non-Chinese solar panel.  The other idea is to very heavily subsidise US companies, which may be better but is also very expensive.  The best solution is to do a mix of both. Otherwise, tariffs will just increase the price in the short-term for US customers, without dealing with the fundamental problem (that the EU and China are taking the leading role in solar energy production, and the US is lagging behind). Just tariffs is putting a plaster over a gaping wound. ',

Meanwhile, power companies have been lobbying and succeeding to kill off any large scale solar company from gaining a foot hold.

But it\'s not reasonable to expect individual companies to be able to compete against the resources of a nation. If the US decided that it would issue a tax credit to car manufacturers for half of the cost of any new car, every country in the world that had domestic car manufacturers would slap a tariff on US cars. (Usually this would be "an additional tariff" - a lot of other countries put tariffs on US products to begin with and China is no exception.)',

They are cheap because of subsidies provided by the Chinese government. Since American panels are not accorded the same luxury, they are at a disadvantage when compared in a terms of cost with Chinese panels.  Blind belief in the market is not what Capitalism is all about. If someone is gaming the competition, then you need to do something about it so that you don\'t become irrelevant.',

Mueller denies it.   Another potential conflict claim is an allegation that Mueller and Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia had a dispute over membership fees when Mueller resigned as a member in 2011, two White House advisers said. A spokesman for Mueller said there was no dispute when Mueller, who was FBI director at the time, left the club. ',

And  The Washington Post reported that the dispute was hardly a dispute at all. According to a person familiar with the matter, Mr Mueller had sent a letter requesting a dues refund in accordance with normal club practice and never heard back.  So he resigned from the golf club but reasons were not given. He asked for his dues back, I assume this is the monthly amount, but never heard back. If it was the monthly amount if could be anywhere from $698 to around eight thousand (assuming monthly dues are paid in annually).  If he was asking for part of the hundred thousand back, I would think there would be more than just an ignored letter. More than likely it was a lot less than $100k back then.  He is getting paid $160k as a special prosecutor whereas he was making a million a year as a lawyer. That would be a hell of a grudge to give up that salary. ',

VW, BMW and(I think Mercedes) paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a study to be done (originally calling for human test subjects riding bicycles to prove no respiratory effects) comparing the exhaust fumes from a new "clean diesel" beatle or Passat (cant remember) to an old F250, by running the engines for hours on end and pumping the exhaust fumes into chambers filled with monkeys. the monkeys were then taken to a lab and had their lung tissues, blood NOx concentration etc measured and compared. upon finding out the study was paid for big car companies, and seeing the results, the researchers essentially cancelled the study and refused to let the big car companies stand behind the "its clean, honestly!" excuse. Edit: so im going to explain a little more about this system after seeing the comment below from /u/xmt447 regarding the Germans turning a blind eye to this. In Europe, car laws and and standards are passed federally, across the whole union, but is enforced by the states. due to each nation being sovereign in its own right, a car can be certified in one country, under that country\'s laws, and providing this is within EU specification, it is then legal in all EU member states. This allows manufacturers of various products to essentially be able to "shop around" so to speak for favourable legislation. Under German law, there is a consumer protection exemption for the emissions requirements, which state that defeat devices may be used should not following them lead to engine damage. Imagine if a brand new diesel particulate filter came out that meant your engine broke down every 30,000 miles. Who would buy that car? Car manufacturers use this as a loophole, claiming that all of their engines longevity is reduced by following the emissions standards. since the car without the defeat device enabled passes emissions testing, it is federally legal. it does what is is supposed to The car is then able to use the defeat device within the EU, since it is allowed by german law. The difference being, that in Europe the cars are taking advantage of a loophole (which admittedly shouldn\'t exist.) but in the States, they were actively cheating the emissions testing.',

Inhalable diesel exhaust particles are not efficiently filtered from the inhaled air, penetrate the respiratory tract deeply, deposit on or translocate across the lung epithelium and can evade otherwise efficient clearance mechanisms. By carrying condensed compounds of potentially high toxicity on their surfaces, these particles function like Trojan horses, allowing semi-volatile and nonvolatile chemicals access to organs, fluids and cellular compartments they could not reach without particles as carriers. The active surfaces of the highly biopersistent solid particle cores are also able to exert adverse effects on biofluids and cells for prolonged periods of time. The overall result is the induction of oxidative stress, pulmonary, systemic inflammation and, partly as a consequence of the latter two and partly via separate pathways, the damage of genomic DNA and thereby the potential formation of mutations and ultimately tumors."',

I think it’ll drop for reasons outside of the control of the US and at times may actually benefit the US economically (overall). But, isolationist policies hurt the US in today’s global economy. And I think Trump’s rhetoric perpetuates this and creates apprehension with potential trade partners.  I don’t know if it’s quantifiable at this point, but negative reactions are justifiable.

If he had said "not those who disagree with America" or "not those who don\'t have America\'s interest at heart" that would be one thing. But he used the word "enemies", even though in the context of his previous words there was no apparent talk of "enemies". So either he just said it completely out of the blue with no contextual reason (as non-contexual as saying "not to illegal immigrants" instead, which would be equally nonsensical) or he\'s directly calling those that voted against him as being enemies. The only alternative explanation is that it was just Trump being Trump. His teleprompter ended the sentence with "only go to friends of America, " and he though "not enemies of America" sounded like a good way to end that sentence without thinking about the previous context. Trump has historically had no problem calling entities that disagree with him "enemies" against him. But a businessman saying "the media is my enemy" is equivalent to saying "the media is biased against me". However, when you\'re the President of the United States, the word "enemy" takes on a completely different meaning, especially when you add "of the United States" after it, and especially during an official address. Maybe Trump didn\'t realize that at the time, though. After all, he is new at this. ',
			'u/juDGe3690 had a wonderful comment earlier (front page) and I felt it deserved a spot here for being so damned relevant. I\'m crossposting his comment here:  This excerpt from Chris Hedges\' 2007 book American Fascists: The Christian Right and the War on America is looking increasingly and frighteningly prescient: America and the Christian religions have no monopoly on goodness or saintliness. God has not chosen Americans as a people above others. … But both the best of American democracy and the best of Christianity embody important values such as compassion, tolerance and belief in justice and equality. …there are times when taking a moral stance, perhaps the highest form of patriotism, means facing down the community, even the nation. Our loyalty to the nation, Reinhold Niebuhr wrote, "is therefore morally tolerable only if it includes values wider than those of the community." These values, democratic and Christian, are being dismantled, often with stealth, by a radical Christian movement, known as Dominionism, which seeks to cloak itself in the mantle of the Christian faith and American patriotism. … It teaches that American Christians have been mandated by God to make America a Christian state. … America becomes, in this militant biblicism, an agent of God, and all political and intellectual opponents of America\'s Christian leaders are viewed, quite simply, as agents of Satan. … Aside from its proselytizing mandate, the federal government will be reduced to the protection of property rights and "homeland" security. … While traditional fundamentalism shares many of the darker traits of the new movement…it has never attempted to impose its belief system on the rest of the nation. And it has not tried to transform government, as well as all other secular institutions, into an arm of the church. Dominionists and their wealthy, right-wing sponsors speak in terms and phrases that are familiar and comforting to most Americans, but they no longer use words to mean what they meant in the past. … There is a slow and inexorable hijacking of religious and political terminology. Terms such as "liberty" and "freedom" no longer mean what they meant in the past. Those in the movement speak of "liberty," but they do not speak about the traditional concepts of American liberty—the liberty to express divergent opinions, to respect other ways of believing and being, the liberty of individuals to seek and pursue their own goals and forms of happiness. When used by the Christian Right, the term "liberty" means the liberty that comes with accepting a very narrowly conceived Christ and the binary worldview that acceptance promotes. … The "infusion" of the "the Spirit of the Lord" into society includes its infusion into society\'s legal system. Liberty is defined as the extent to which America obeys Christian law. While the radical Christian movement\'s leaders pay lip service to traditional justice, they call among their own for a legal system that promotes what they define as "Christian principles." The movement thus is able to preserve the appearance of law and respect for democracy even as its leaders condemn all opponents—dismissed as "atheists," "nonbelievers," or "secular humanists"—to moral and legal oblivion. Justice, under this process of logocide, is perverted to carry out injustice and becomes a mirage of law and order. The moral calculus no longer revolves around the concept of universal human rights; now its center is the wellbeing, protection and promotion of "Bible-believing Christians." ',

For example, after Israel, the country that we provide the next highest amount of aid to is Egypt. The basis of this aid is partially that Egypt has a peace deal with Israel. But the peace deal is very frosty and almost nominal. Egyptians and Israelis have very little contact, and there exists massive amounts of animosity amongst Egyptians against Israel and Israelis (to not even get into general antisemitism). It is generally not safe for Israelis in Egypt.
