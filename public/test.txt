			'This guy slums !',
			'I only wish my local park had such sturdy benches ',
			'Not even homeless but some days when it\'s nice out I really just want to nap surrounded by nature on a park bench. Why am I telling you this and why does it matter? I don\'t know and it doesn\'t matter.',
			'What do you call a guy with no body and no nose? Nobody Knows',
			'Shut up dad. ',
			'Actually better. No risk of falling down. ',
			'I feel that could pose a safety hazard, since anybody who wriggled in wouldn\'t be able to quickly get off the bench if they had to (for instance if they were attacked). ',

			'Oh look at Mr. Fancy Multiplier Guy over here!',

			'You could put a tarp over that and you\'ve got yourself a shelter. ',
			'I don’t understand how this is new news, they’ve been doing this forever in several towns near me. (South-East England) It’s silly too because they will just find other places to sleep, you’re just moving the problem not solving it.',
			'The spikes in doorways/window sills have been around for years as well although I think a few councils have recently moved them after much protest.',
			'Spikes on window sills? What purpose? To prevent break ins?',
			'It\'s called defensive architecture. Spikes and uncomfortable surfaces above waist level are to stop birds from nesting, loitering. Spikes and uncomfortable surfaces waist level and lower are to stop humans from nesting, loitering. ',

			'Well, one of the last things bournemouth council were doing was giving the homeless one way tickets for the train to leave the town',
			'and if they didn\'t leave they played irritating music in the station so you couldn\'t sleep there either.',
			'Yeah, I would run away too if I heard Alvin and the chipmunks ',
			'And playing Alvin and The Chipmunks at a bus depot all night to drive homeless sleepers away. In the UK there have also been devices called Mosquitos that emit a high frequency noise that is mainly only heard by the youth. They used to put them in places where bored youths congregate and it was supposed to annoy them out of the area. We had one near some shops in my home town but after much publicity and public opposition it was taken down and in the last few years nobody tried to use one since the outcry last time.  I think they are horrible things.',
			'ockquote> you’re just moving the problem not solving it.  That\'s the idea. Out of sight out of mind. ',
			'Moving it to somebody else\'s jurisdiction ',
			'Well, to be fair, the goal wasn\'t "out of sight out of mind," it was literally "move the problem so that people can sit on the benches during the day...that\'s why we have benches." Of course a better solution would be to find better places for the homeless to sleep. But that is also a much more costly and complicated thing to solve. And directing the homeless to those better places would require having people do that work, etc. I imagine someone on the council just getting pissed about people continually bitching about not being able to ever find a bench because people were sleeping on them and then did the cheapest thing they could think of to get their phone to stop ringing.',
			'Plus it raises the question of who’s responsibility is it to address the issue? Is the local Council suppose to solve the homeless issue? Do they have the resources to address it? What do they give up if they use their resources to address it? Do their local constituents want to give those things up? Or is it a federal/national responsibility to address? But if it is, are resources better spent in this town or is the homeless situation for drastic/dire somewhere else? What resources are necessary to address it and are they available? What oversight is necessary since this is a larger addressing of the issue? Are the resources available for the oversight? Who runs the thing? Are they qualified? What defines qualified? Does the government have the impetus to solve the issue without an election featuring the issue?',
			'That\'s San Francisco, California\'s strategy. Just bus them out to other towns and they pretend like they\'ve done them a huge favor. As someone who lived in far Northern California (Shasta County) I can attest to the fact that it is literally just moving the problem to other cities that have even less resources to handle it. But hey for SF, out of sight, out of mind.',
			'The problem with San Francisco is that even if you are working full time on minimum wage, it is still not remotely enough to afford housing/rent, let alone any other living expenses in the area.',
			'I agree, it\'s certainly difficult to live well in SF. And if you consider the quality of the unit in relation to the price it\'s often a ripoff. When I worked in Mountain View I remember looking at houses/apartments that were insanely overpriced. I stayed in a 2 bed/2 bath apartment with a few roommates in Sunnyvale with a $5500/mo rent. Had no heating/air, super basic amenities, ant infestation the very first day we moved in. My example is certainly not representative of the entire Bay Area but it was not a pleasant experience and I\'ve heard similar complaints.',
			'Literally nobody thought this would solve the homeless crisis.',
			'Maybe this is unusual in the UK, but in the States, bus benches have been inhospitable to homeless people for decades. The bar shown in this photo is a little more obvious and direct than the designs I usually see, but there\'s no question that the benches are intentionally made to be uncomfortable or even impossible to sleep on. Hell, they\'re not even comfortable to sit on for more than about 20 minutes.',
			'It’s really not that unusual here. Maybe it’s big news in this area for whatever reason, but it’s a widely known thing.',
			'I think its more because they\'re so blatantly retrofitted for that purpose. If they\'d replaced the benches with a different model that happened to be incompatible with rough sleeping, nobody would bat an eye.',
			'minneapolis has some you can lean back on and not even sit on',
			'Yeh they have those in the UK too ',
			'They do the same thing in some airports.',
			'Most airports do this as far as I can tell. It\'s infuriating when the place is empty and you\'ve got to wait 6 hours for your flight and the place is designed to not allow you to be comfortable.',
			'Yeah it\'s crazy. The first time I flew out of my local airport alone (I think I was like 15-16?) I was super super nervous about being late/missing it so I arrived around 2 hours early for an 8am flight. Since I\'d gotten up that early I was still super tired so I rested my head on my luggage to sleep and at freaking 7ish in the morning a security guard came over and said "sorry sir no laying down on the chairs". Wtf?!',
			'Comfort is for people who pay $100 for access to the airport lounge.',
			'Some city recently paid homeless people to help clear trash. That not only gave them a purpose in life, but some managed to land proper jobs later. There needs to be some effort on behalf of the government to fix this besides simply giving a shelter for a night and some food.',
			'I never understood this. So many times people need to spend the night shivering in an airport due to shitty airlines. You need a $500 ticket just to sit on the hotel benches in the first place so homelessness in airports is not really a problem. ',
			'I’m guessing it’s because of selfish assholes who will stretch out across several seats when the gate is busy. Ever not been able to find a seat at your gate, meanwhile a bunch of seats are taken up by people’s bags? Now imagine a bunch of people taking up 4 seats each so they can get a nap in. ',
			'Came on here to post the same thing. Imagine have a delayed or canceled flight, and then having to sleep on the disgusting floor. As if flying didn\'t suck enough to begin with. This is inhumane.',
			'This is why I travel with one of these giant inflatable vaginas They inflate in just a few seconds by waving them around and work great for naps. ',
			'How much are those? Saw tons of them at a music festival last year',
			'$15-$30ish.',
			'ockquote> inflatable vaginas  AKA "air lounger" or "air sofa" for anyone else interested. Thanks for mentioning this, by the way. First I\'ve heard of them.',
			'Every airport I\'ve been in has single person seats, not benches for sleeping.',
			'...exactly ',
			'The way I read this conversation was "airports are now putting in partitions" which they aren\'t. They\'ve just never had benches in them to begin with. I mean, I\'ve seen some outside, but I don\'t think I can recall a single airport that didn\'t have a majority of single person seats in the 30 years I\'ve been flying on airplanes. It\'s not inhumane, it\'s just the way their designed. I\'d much rather have my own seat than try and squeeze in between people.',
			'They\'ve been doing this for years here in Singapore, weird how nobody talks about it around here.',
			'Because your newspapers can\'t',
			'Does singapore not have freedom of press?',
			'Rumour has it that the govt steers the press a little. Some things just don\'t get reported. It\'s relaxing more these days and they\'re not bad compared to other countries in Asia but they\'re far from being free',
			'Do people still manage to sleep on them?',
			'Yes, but in Singapore they fine you to hell and back for possession of chewing gum. I imagine you\'d get euthanised on the spot for sleeping on a public bench. Or maybe forced to eat durian, I\'m not sure which is worse.',
			'I had a sip of my friend\'s Durian Smoothie three nights ago. It was horrible, I still gag when I think about it. ',
			'I exclusively stay in hotels that don\'t permit Durians when traveling in Asia. Ok not quite, but I make note of the ones that have NO DURIAN signs all over and make a point to return to those establishments.',
			'What is durian ?',
			'It\'s a fruit that looks kind of like a pineapple, with flesh that is soft and sweet, but also tastes and smells -- strongly -- of rotten onion and acetone. They\'re like the fruit version of microwaving fish in the office lounge...some folks love to eat them, but NOBODY wants to smell them.',
			'I often see "non-news" things come through the international filter from the UK. I\'m not really sure why. Maybe it\'s the nanny-state narrative but usually what does show up on my feed is surreal stuff about surveillance or how someone needed to present their ID to buy spoons or something.',
			'In Los Angeles, there’s plenty of room for people in the shelters. The main reason they don’t stay is because they don’t want to follow the house rules e.g. no alcohol, drugs, etc. This is according to the LAPD at least.',
			'It’s the same here in Sacramento, where you can be sent away from a shelter if you’re visibly drunk or on other drugs. Also, most shelters don’t allow the homeless to bring in their pets.',
			'Intoxication can make people unpredictable especially in a group where mental health problems are already an issue, this leads to a safety risk to everyone present including staff, volunteers, and other \'guests\'. Pets particularly those living on the streets are at significant risk of infections both bacterial and pest, violent behaviour as well, and a lack of toilet training.  Shelters are trying their best in a very complex situation.',
			'And a shit pile of them don\'t take single men, or are forcefully religious.',
			'Why don\'t they take single men?',
			'Heard some homeless people say it is safer to sleep outside than at shelters. Since you\'re usually locked in with someone who could be okay or be a crazed violent person going through withdrawal. ',
			'My town has removed or reduced barriers for people to be in shelter - people can come in drunk or high, but they can\'t do it on the premises. It\'s a balance they are striking between not hindering someone entering a shelter, and protecting people who are trying to get sober who are already in the shelter. They\'re also welcome to bring their dogs. Once in shelter, there are wraparound services to try to get people into housing....but there\'s the challenge. In California, there is no affordable housing for most of these people. Meanwhile, neighbors are negatively impacted by some of the behaviors - drug use, defecation, etc.  It\'s a mess.',
			'Only a small percentage fall into this category, the vast majority won\'t go to shelters for safety reasons, for theft reasons, and because of health issues, sanitation, and the availability of space. Most shelters are not well planned, funded, or ran properly, and it shows in the low quality and even abusive environments present in many shelters, especially large ones. ',
			'This is most correct. A few years back I was at risk for becoming homeless in Seattle, I did a lot of research online and spoke to former homeless and the message was the same, avoid shelters at all costs. They are filthy, have bedbugs, have aggressive mentally ill residents and unemployable ex convicts. The recommendation was to live in a car if you had one or outside in the elements rather than go to a shelter. And if you have a job, forget about staying at a shelter, they close for the night before many people get off work. ',
			'In Cambridge, MA the reason I didn\'t stay in the homeless shelter was that one of their rules is I have to put my bag on a shelf and can\'t sleep with it under my head.  They were forcing me to follow insecure procedures so I opted to sleep outside.',
			'I\'m ok with this kind of thing in the interest of keeping public parks safe but it needs to be paired with good funding for homeless shelters along with aid and mental health programs to get these people on their feet.',
			'Unfortunately, many chronic homeless (the kind that is likely to be sleeping on park benches), have mental health problems that prevent them from getting "on their feet". Severe, chronic mental illness isn\'t always something you can overcome.',
			'There are a significant number of rough sleepers in the UK who don\'t want accommodation for various reasons. I know someone who works for a homeless charity and they get calls all the time about the same people. They go out and offer help and a place off the street but there\'s no interest in taking it.',
			'I’m not certain of the UK, but in the US, it’s often due to the poor quality of security. They have their things stolen, they’re mistreated or pitied instead of motivated or aided. It’s a difficult sector of care that doesn’t get the proper attention or funding when it comes to our side of the pond. Does your friend have any insight or reasoning as to why they turn them down?',
			'I\'ve been told not to go to shelters due to the likelihood of me being raped. The police told me this after I asked to be driven to one to get out of an abusive home. I\'m older now and I\'ve been thinking of going anyway if I get told to leave where I am now. ',
			'Holy fuck',
			'Did they say not to go to any shelter or “don’t go to X shelter” specifically? There may be women’s only shelters where you might feel safer.',
			'I wonder if men who bitch about women\'s-only shelters realize this^',
			'I just read this article, and found it interesting: https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/why_homeless_people_avoid_shelters',
			'Speaking as someone who lived in a homeless shelter it\'s a scary place. Frequently Woken up by police due to drug arrests as well being woken up to a corridor covered in blood as a homeless guy stabbed a woman in the face. The others staying there were drug addicts or ex-cons or both! Creepy guys going on at length about prison shankings and the like. People trying to steal what little stuff you have left and the people in charge treating you like crap. Not surprised at all when people prefer to avoid the shelters. ',
			'Security problems really boil down to overcrowding and poor staffing, which again is a funding issue. People feel good that their city/town has a shelter that is helping people, but they don’t always want to pay what is necessary for the shelter to run efficiently and safely.',
			'They say that, but i know for a fact that charities like Shelter turn away people unless theyre completely clean. Any drug use, alcohol abuse, current criminal behavior, or if they\'ve previously been housed but their behavior was "bad" and they toss them back on the street with a "sorry lol, we tried" and then say these people dont want to be homed.  Honestly sickens me. If anyone reading has ever tried to quit smoking or drinking, you\'ll know quitting drugs and chronic behavoir is a lot harder than going "okay I\'ll just stop then"  But you know, whatever. We\'ll just say they dont wanna be homed and write them off as not our problem',
			'I work with homeless in my area often. Almost every one has been around all the shelters and hostels and kicked out and its not for being "bad" or being a bit of a rascal, its for being criminal or dangerous. A few years ago one drunken homeless person jumped on anothers head until it was completely caved in because he had drink and the other guy wanted it. I know of volunteers who have been assaulted, sexually assaulted and even stabbed. This tends to be why they have strict policies. Its for the protection of those using the shelters and those running it. These arent people who are down on their luck they tend to be people with very difficult to manage issues and the UK fails them. The solution is better mental health care which in the UK is very much a neglected service which is ridiculous as better mental health care will reduce criminality, it will reduce hospital admissions, it will reduce homelessness and unemployment and will reduce drug and alcohol abuse. And I have seen many that will refuse shelter no matter what. Usually this ties in well with the whole mental health thing.',
			'There are people who genuinely want to be on the streets for various reasons. It\'s a small minority, and they may be very disturbed or have what could be seen as a warped outlook on life, but they do exist. Part of the problem is that a shelter isn\'t a prison or mental hospital and isn\'t equipped to cope with people under the influence of drugs/alcohol or mental health issues who may be disruptive or violent. It sucks that they turn people away who need help, but I can understand why it happens.',
			'Not to be mean but a bad 10% could make a shelter unlivible for the rest. It is easy to say, but can you imagine living in a shelter if the fucking thing were like Mad Max with a side of prison rape? ',
			'And quitting cold turkey for many substances, including alcohol, can be fatal. It kills people.',
			'Yea, in the US the homeless I\'ve made friends with or speak to hate going to shelters because they have to watch their stuff (pay more attention to ensure their stuff isn\'t taken than they do on the street) or risk getting it stolen. Especially disabled or blind homeless avoid the shelters, because the few I\'ve spoken to say they are constant targets by others who think they are weaker and easier to steal from. ',
			'The easiest explainable reason is hostels and shelters won\'t take people on drink or drugs. Or there are issues with the local shelters themselves and the people who frequent them. ',
			'And I don\'t know how it goes there but here I\'m in California we have a bunch that choose this life, you offer them help or a place to stay and they tell you they wanted this life to avoid rules in the first place. Well alright then...',
			'Sounds like they need to be put in a mental health institute if it\'s that bad? Or else any solution isn\'t enough because they just won\'t use it. So basically unless you want a police state policy there will be some amount of homeless folks.',
			'It\'s a rough situation with no real right answer. They\'re not hurting anyone so should they really lose their freedom and be detained in an institution? Especially a mental health institution which is notoriously subpar? While it might be a solution, the drawback is that it\'s expensive for taxpayers and the guy would probably much rather be out on the streets or in a group home. But at the same time usually these are the guys who can\'t function in a group home. Often the best course is just to let them be and make sure they have access to meal centres, but even then it\'s just a partial solution. How to help the homeless (cheaply, no municipality wants to spend a dollar more than they have to on people who don\'t contribute to the local economy) is a really tough issue - there\'s entire specialized degrees on various answers to the homeless question EDIT: Not really sure what the guy below me is trying to say. Why would a municipality skim off the top of stocks and bonds? Rich people in rich houses pay significant property taxes, they contribute far more to the local economy than the homeless. I\'m all for eating the rich in general, but I don\'t think that really applies here',
			'And who pays for that? Reagan dismantled the public mental health system in the US, and it isn\'t coming back.',
			'This is in the UK though',
			'And even before then, said system was being exposed left and right for the inhumane treatments they were putting patients through. Many asylums closed for this reason (Letchworth Village comes to mind).',
			'And while the mental health system has made huuuuuuge strides since then, there\'s also the issue that a lot of people who are homeless don\'t have mental health issues and don\'t need that treatment - they need a place to stay and a job. Actually, providing those two things would probably help a lot of the homeless people who do have mental illness. Not having a home or job would certainly make me mentally ill.',
			'I know we Americans like to think we are the only ones who exist and matter but this article is in the UK. Reagan didn’t have anything to do with their mental health systems. ',
			'You can\'t put people against their will into institutions anymore',
			'Actually, you can under the mental health act 1983.',
			'Lol yeah you can. Just they aren\'t called asylums anymore.they\'re mental health ward\'s. Located in hospitals. Usually on a high floor with doors that lock from both sides. I knew a lady who was in one for more than a year. Granted she did threaten suicide when arrested on a drunk and disorderly. So they put you on the "three" day hold. She has no recollection as she was blackout drunk and normally not suicidal I\'m any way. Well she gets explained what happened, agrees to stay the three days, not that she had any choice and starts waiting it out. They have her see a therapist and do some group stuff with the other, actually crazy people. Well day three is here. She asks what time she will be released. "Oh well its been extended a day as the therapist wishes to see you again tomorrow." ok no point in arguing. Sees the guy. They talk. She asks " ok so what time will I be discharged tomorrow?" well she isn\'t being. Therapist reccomends to have her stay extended by a week. Well I don\'t know if any of you have been in a "mental health ward" but its not pleasant. After already being there for the better part of the week she starts getting on edge. And unfortunately the wards aren\'t long term. So they send her to a longer term inpatient treatment facility. Well now you\'ve gone from a not horrible but uncomfortable situation right into a living nightmare. She has now gone 5 days as a no call no show. They don\'t let you keep your cell phone or clothes you came in with. She didn\'t know but she lost her job. Meanwhile all of her friends on the outside are scrambling trying to find her. We know they took her to the hospital. But as we weren\'t family we had no right to inquire about her or where she was. Her only family was on the other side of the country so no help there. We were in the dark. No clue what happened. I feared the worst. Well she wasn\'t doing great.apparently movies aren\'t horribly off when it comes to those places. Screaming at all hours of the night. Someone shining a flashlight on you every hour at night. Definetly not good for mental health. She cane back around about 6 months after the whole ordeal. It was eye opening how poorly she was treated. Only way the released her was on a large dose of pills. She went from an energetic person always ready to take on the day with a good job to a well. Shell. There\'s still some horrors in the mental health world. Just not as noticible.',
			'You can in the UK',
			'You certainly can. There\'s the classic 5150, a 72 hour involuntary hold, often referred to as "suicide watch." You can also obtain a court order for someone to be involuntarily committed. Some, but not all, jurisdictions restrict it to spouses and blood relatives. My daughter was taken into "care" for a 5150, but kept for months until she was no longer considered dangerous to herself or others. ',
			'The parks should be kept safe even if we can\'t house the homeless though. The same way we should be treating people with drug addiction issues, but we shouldn\'t allow them to hang out in the parks and leave needles behind just because we haven\'t funded a treatment program for them yet. We need to do both things, but you don\'t have to wait to do one until you can do both.',
			'Even when there are adequate shelters, the homeless don\'t like to use them because there are too many rules, no drug use, no pets allowed. Also they get their stuff stolen because they are forced to live around other homeless and they HATE the homeless more than you and I do. ',
			'Housing without a door that locks isn\'t real housing. Would you choose to live somewhere where you stand a good chance of getting robbed, stabbed, or raped every night? Shelters that provided warm, locking cubicles (however spartan) would be a much more "real" solution in terms or providing something resembling stability than what we do now.',
			'Yeah, too many people miss the point of "treating people decently" and only see/hear "we did something, they don\'t like it" when all they did was the bare minimum required. Most homeless shelters don\'t treat humans humanely, they just put a roof over their head. Even if their goal is to move them away from your park benches they\'re STILL not accomplishing that goal because the facities are bad enough that large numbers of people don\'t want to stay there.  So not only are they failing to "treat people decently" they\'re failing in the mission of "just make them go away" as well.',
			'1000% this. Hundreds of shelter beds in California are empty each night.',
			'Shelters can be violent, you can be almost guaranteed to get your stuff stolen in many of them, sometimes they have fees or hourly restrictions you miss (have to be in before X and out by Y but you also had to get across town that day to try to apply for housing or wait in line for food), some are forcefully religious, etc. There are lots of very good reasons that shelter beds might be empty.',
			'They often outright turn away single men. edit: I am not an MRA, those guys below who are braying about patriarchy are assholes. All I am doing is pointing out why those beds may be empty. Many shelters prioritize women, women with kids, and families; with the myriad of problems facing the homeless community, it\'s a shitty choice that has to be made due to the prevalence of unstable mental health, drug and alcohol issues that can cause problems inside a shelter.',
			'So... they turn away the vast majority of homeless people?',
			'Yeah actually. I volunteered at a homeless shelter and they had a much nicer "apartment style" setup that you could move into for a month max and they were women and children only. Had open ones too but wouldn\'t setup a dude in one. ',
			'Which is funny, because 3 of 4 homeless are men. ',
			'But the ad said 1/4 homeless were women! /s',
			'As much as that sucks, it\'s nice for everyone else to sit on a bench that hasn\'t been pissed on recently, in a park that hasn\'t been trampled and riddled with syringes and poop. It\'s shitty for anyone to spoil access to public amenities. I don\'t think letting someone sleep on a bench is particularly altruistic, if you\'re going to argue against barriers, why not work to solve the (deep and complex) problem? I feel like too many homelessness solutions are clumsy band aid fixes to serve those who want to feel good about helping. ',
			'ockquote> clumsy band aid fixes  Putting rails on park benches is a clumsy band aid fix.',
			'That doesn\'t solve the problem, it just displaces it onto someone else.  These bars might make homeless people go elsewhere... and then those problems you complain about will happen wherever else they wind up. If you want to treat them like some walking malignancy, all you\'re doing is concentrating it onto other poorer areas that can\'t afford to build barriers to them. ',
			'ockquote> That doesn\'t solve the problem, it just displaces it onto someone else.  This is a fundamental problem with the way many issues are handled.  Take the problems with mass shootings in America. Schools get shot up? People say we should arm the teachers or put cops all over every school. Great... so now that schools are a secure location, the mass shooters will just go shoot up a day care. So we put armed guards at all day cares. Great... now the mass shooters will shoot up a mall... so we put arm guards at the mall.  The solution of hardening a target just means the problem (be it vagrants or gunmen) will move onto a softer target, but the underlying problem is never solved.',
			'Great analogy. Like what do you all want to arm everyone or actually figure out why this happens in the first place and fix that overall issue. ',
			'Looking deeper into those issues usually exposes systemic problems that important people usually like to keep covered up.',
			'Seems to me the biggest problem we have with school shootings is with kids that are actually going to the school and being mistreated. I don\'t think those kids necessarily want to go and just shoot something, IE going to a daycare to shoot babies. They go to shoot the people and the place where they feel they have been mistreated. Maybe a few people who are so insecure with yourselves that you need to pick on someone else were to stop picking on someone else and start picking them up we would have less shootings. Or we could just put up automatic sentry guns....',
			'It depends on the problem you\'re working to solve. If it\'s homelessness then no, it doesn\'t if it\'s keeping people from sleeping on benches, then, yes, it does.',
			'I was on a road trip in the southern city with my family a few years ago. We went to restaurant with good reviews on yelp. We had noticed a park with a nice playground on the way in, so my wife and kids walked down there while I waited to pay the bill.  15 minutes later, I get the car and drive down. When I get there, everything seems off. I walk up and meet my wife who just gives me a look. I\'m looking around at this point. I don\'t see any kids, or any families. About 100 feet from us were roughly a dozen+ people, mostly middle age poorly dressed men sitting on park benches, some staring in our direction. We never felt threatened or unsafe. But, we felt very uncomfortable. We stayed for about 5 more minutes, took the kids and left. As we were driving away, everyone was making their way back to the play ground.  Talked to my wife. She said as they walked to the park, everyone got up and left and sat on the edge where I saw them. Best we could figure, it was the local homeless hangout (with everything that goes along with that).  Props to someone, we didn\'t see needles or trash around. But, the atmosphere was certainly enough to keep all the local families away, and keep us from staying long. So, this small town spent a ton of money installing a brand new playground yet the children who were supposed to use it weren\'t able to. So, I\'m not sure what you want to do. This vulnerable group (low income children) were being hurt because no one wanted to run off another group. ',
			'My city repurposed a former school building for homeless to sleep overnight. The immediate result: an significant increase in used needles and human feces in the nearby playground. Shelter isn\'t enough and are just a band-aid to make us feel good. Programs and a longer-term rehabilitation program are definitely needed. However, while we should do more it must be recognised that some people can\'t be helped - at least in terms of becoming regular\'ish positive citizens - and we need a strategy to separate and deal a with them from the general homeless population. Homelessness, addiction, mental illness, and criminality all often appear in similar circles but are in reality all different problems with no single solution for a given condition. Even there\'s could be divided into sub-categories, as some people recover more easily than others.',
			'Oh I agree with you. My dad does a lot of farmers markets downtown and I\'ve heard some horror stories from him. That being said putting rails on benches is a bit of a "bandaid" solution and programs to get people out of poverty will help us in the long run. Hard to get politicians to think long term sometimes though.',
			'Just because someone implements a short term solution on proposed a small change it doesn\'t mean they aren\'t thinking of the long term. I see this argument a lot and it always bothers me. There isn\'t one thing that will fix homelessness. But there are a million things that will help. However, if every time someone does something small it\'s torn apart for not being something HUGE than nothing will get done at all. Salt Lake City, Utah has really been focusing a lot on their chronic homeless problem but every step has been met with a massive push back with people criticizing everything that the new programs DON\'T do. They\'re straight up giving homes to the homeless but people complained that basic needs and medical care is the REAL problem and not having a home is just a by-product of the REAL problem. They increased policing in high crime areas where homeless where overdosing and violent crime was out of control. People complained they were criminalizing homelessness. They added more shelters beds, increased availability to rehab, mental health support, job placement, and community support and people complained that all those are useless if they\'re not fixing the problem of WHY these people are homeless in the first place. Everything that has been done has been called a "band-aid". So yeah, sure. They\'re band-aids. But until we invent the "magic-problem-solver ray" they\'re what we\'ve got.',
			'I\'m not saying what I have here is the same everywhere, but I know in my area (Springfield, MO) there are TONS of resources for homeless people. They will even pay your rent at a place of YOUR choosing on top of all the other government aid. My girlfriend worked for a behavioral health place here helping people who are homeless or extremely poor, and the consensus was that 99% of the people who are there don\'t even try. Which is sad because all you have to do is say "hi i need help", so one can deduce that either A. they\'re not advertising well enough or B. it\'s easier to stand on the corner and beg for money. I\'d like to help anyone who needs it, but you can\'t help someone who won\'t help themselves.',
			'This is not a bad suggestion, but you should probably accept that there is a certain contingent that will never get on their feet. How do we handle those people? And should we "handle them" at all? I don\'t have the answer, but it\'s the real question.',
			'"Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me... Except the really stinky or yucky ones."',
			'"Go forth and sell all your possessions and then follow me. Except for your six-figure salaries and pool and brand new mustaaang!"',

			'Supply-side Jesus, I believe he likes to be called.',
			'Great band name. ',
			'This is far from Republican. I have my doubts the leadership of Bournemouth are anywhere near the US right. This is a problem that crosses almost every ideology with power.',
			'The Baltimore and Annapolis trail in MD use to tolerate homeless being nasty washing underwear out in water fountains. That was till a joggers were being sexually assaulted by the homeless and they found the body of a missing bicyclist that hadn\'t been seen for 3 years because some vagrant stabbed him and took his bike. Can\'t say I missed the days riding by a guy getting a blowjob in the open by the playground. How about instead of focusing on what we do to keep them from ruining recreation areas we focus on lack of solutions to get single males off the street. Bitching about a bar on a bench isn\'t caring either. That\'s just complaining about a shit solution being closed off that was cheap to the tax payer. ',
			'It also looks like they installed those bars upside down? The bar looks like it tries to follow the shape of the existing armrests if they\'d flip it around. So instead of splitting a bench into two seats, they\'ve thrown this fuckoff awkward bar in the middle.',
			'There\'s something wrong when we tackle homelessness by making things more uncomfortable to sleep on. Bit whack-a-mole.',
			'There’s a movement in the midsized town i grew up in - called “Clean up [city]”. They want the homeless moved out of the city. Never do I see representatives helping homeless people, or trying to end homelessness, rather, they just want the police to bus them to another town.  So many people who want homelessness to end have not the requisite compassion to ever see it through. ',
			'I love the double-leveled selfishness. "I\'m sick of these homeless people!" as well as "I don\'t care what happens to that other town!" ',
			'Part of the problem is that Bournemouth attracts homeless from other areas. It is a seaside beach resort and regarded as quite a wealthy area so if ya gotta be homeless then why not head to a better area. I am not lacking in social conscience but as the burden falls on local councils to fund shelters and other programs to get people off the streets you can understand why the council would want to put out the message and take measures to discourage rough sleepers from certain parts of the town.',
			'People who upvote threads like this would quickly change their opinion about the homeless if they were forced to deal with hobos loitering, vandalizing and shitting on heir property. Virtue signaling from behind a computer screen is easy.',
			'I have lived in three of the most popular hobo areas in the US. SF, Oakland, and San Jose.  When you deal with multiple homeless people everyday, it makes it even more clear that they have been left behind and that they need help. These people can\'t just disappear. They need to be given housing and put into either a job training program, rehab, or a mental health facility. Leaving them on the street is the worst option both morally, and fiscally. ',
			'I used to live in a really shitty area and dealt with homeless people going to the toilet outside of my flat regularly. I still agree that this kind of thing is messed up and that these people deserve better because they\'re human and I\'m not an asshole.',
			'Yeah. I wonder how many of those bitching about homeless people going to the toilet have noticed the utter lack of public toilets these days. It may be anti-social but there is no escaping biology, they need to eat, sleep, piss and shit like any other living being. If they have nowhere else to do those things its going to be in the street.',
			'My city always has loud arguments whenever the idea of putting in public toilets in subway stations is brought up, because "but homeless people will use them". I don\'t get it. Right now they (and the general public, especially drunk folks) are just using the subway elevators. That seems like the worst of all options.  I get that toilets need someone to clean them-- but right now that someone is cleaning the elevators, which has got to be a nastier job than cleaning the same liquids and solids in a normal bathroom setting.',
			'God forbid that those people shit in the areas we literally designed for shitting',
			'Its crazy really.',
			'Maybe if we gave housing to homeless people they wouldn\'t forced to shit in public. ',
			'The next logical step is to electrify things at random. This would also be an effective deterrent to public urination...',
			'Never knew these benches were meant for the homeless. ',
			'What\'s really inhumane here is just how ugly that bar looks...',
			'They are using a hostile strategy when they need to use a hostel strategy.',
			'How’s that any different than those metal clips on concrete that stop skateboarders? Undesired action, built in deterrent. ',
			'I thought I was taking crazy pills, this isn\'t new whatsoever. Slanted bench seats, jagged gravel under overpasses, thorny bushes, water sprinklers, urine deflectors on the sides of buildings, that\'s just what comes to mind. There\'s always a strong reaction when the design is ugly, but when it looks nice there\'s no reaction at all. It\'s like people aren\'t upset about the homeless, they\'re upset they\'re reminded about the homeless.',
			'A lot of the comments in this thread are making an extremely complicated subject into something black and white.  Five years ago the public library I worked at redesigned their park with "defensive architecture" in mind. Which is essentially things like benches that don\'t encourage sleeping, well lit paths, full vision. We did this because of constant complains from parents and community members that they no longer felt safe in the park and they were right not to feel safe. There were constantly used needles, empty beer cans and people selling or using drugs in the park. It reached a point where the people using our park were negatively impacting community\'s perception of the library. ',
			'This is standard now, current policy is for new benches to be of a design with individual seats',
			'Looks like a don\'t roll off in your sleep bar to me. ',
			'This isn’t inhumane. The benches are there to be sat on enjoyed by people of the area. Not used as a bed for 8 hrs straight in the middle of the day. Plus, no one feels safe being at, shopping at, or going to a park that has homeless people sleeping around. Especially with your young kids. The risk is too high. So now you have public places that are unusable by those who paid for them. ',
			'I agree. Seems like there are a lot of people who have never dealt with the homeless before in this thread. The reality is that being homeless doesn\'t entitle you to monopolize public space. I deal with the homeless every day, and I absolutely support these measures. ',
			'Progressive countries are installing single seat "benches" (chairs?) in parks to keep them as seats, not homeless beds.',
			'wow, so progressive',
			'I\'ve seen this done in cities over California for years why the outcry now? ',
			'Unpopular opinion. But when I\'m trying to wait for the bus, I\'d like to sit and not have to tell a bum I can\'t spare any cash. I\'d like to actually sit on the benches. I don\'t want my local park to turn into "Hobo Jungle". It sucks. I hate it. I wish there was something that could be done about it. But as it stands, I\'d much rather see these bars and spikes making it harder for hobos to "live" around the general population and sleeping in these public places. ',
			'Have you ever went to a park with a dozen or so benches/tables and have seen most of them taken by the homeless? Literally taken ALL day and night (if they aren\'t booted). The design of these benches/tables isn\'t necessarily about being available to stop a homeless person from laying down. It\'s to stop them from making it THEIR furniture and the center piece of THEIR living quarters. However much one cares or don\'t care about the homeless... you\'d be a liar or an idiot if you "didn\'t mind" that the nice park, in the nice neighbor, where you provide a nice life for your family is a homeless haven/camp. A very simple thing to approach the problem is designing furniture uncomfortable enough for people to call their home.',
			'I lived right next to a women\'s shelter for a year. It makes the neighborhood even worse. Now you have a hub for a bunch of nut jobs and drug addicts to hang out outside all day long. The neighbors hate it because it drives down property value and makes the place feel less safe. The last night before moving I almost got into a fistfight with a drugged out shelter lady past her curfew who tried running at me and touching me. I had girls from the shelter hanging out in front of my building smoking weed like you don\'t live hereeeee. Bad experiences in general. '

Lots of girls say uncut is gross and almost all guys who are say they will do it to their kids. But once again anecdotal. I’ll probably still get downvoted. ',

			'That’s the one of the best “emotional” arguments or cases against circumcision IMO... Obviously there are far better logical arguments against circumcision but unfortunately it seems like most people care more about how things make them feel rather than the logic and reason behind something.  Ask a pro-circumcision person to sit down and watch an actual circumcision happening to an infant boy. If they start getting sick, demand to turn it off or just walk away... then ask them this.. “if you can’t even watch this happening to someone else, then what gives you the right to force your infant boy to go through it?”  Them: “Yeah well, he’s a baby so he won’t even remember it when he gets older!” “Okay, so it’s perfectly okay to hurt and victimize others just as long as they don’t remember it later on? .... In that case, take some of this horse tranquilizer so I can beat the shit out of you while you’re passed out. It’s okay though cuz you won’t remember it when you wake up!”  EDIT: Already getting downvotes huh? Lol...

			'Admittedly not fully informed on the debate, but there’s a key difference between male and female genital cutting/circumcision. When female genital mutilation is performed, it’s not a cosmetic procedure. The clitoris, which is a pleasure area for many women, is cut or basically removed. The anatomical equivalent to FGM for men would be if someone removed or basically destroyed the glans of the penis to preclude that man from experiencing feeling in the tip of his penis/the organ in general. The end goal of FGM is to prevent women from feeling sexual pleasure from clitoral stimulation. I’m not saying whether it’s right or wrong to remove them (I frankly don’t think about it... at all) but foreskin removal does not preclude men from achieving sexual pleasure/orgasm. The end goals of the two procedures are not the same, and that is why that they’re regarded differently by the global community. Conflating them is not useful to your argument if your wish is to prevent men from getting circumcised.',
			'You\'re absolutely wrong. That is *one type" of FGM. Not even most common.  Most FGM is the same as male circumcision. It removes the clitoral hood and or parts of the labia. The clitoris it self is left intact and most of sexual pleasure remains. You\'re simply wrong ',
			'The glans of a penis is nothing compared to the foreskin in terms of sensitivity.  My glans is less sensitive than the heel of my foot. Anyone who\'s cut like me can test this: get a toothpick and gently brush the glans (the head) of your penis. Then gently brush other parts of your body where the skin is thick and un-sensitive. Try the heel of your foot, and the wrinkled skin of your elbow.  Compare the levels of sensitivity.',
			'Male genital mutilation banned',
			'AAP guidelines A lot of the US guidelines come from American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and everyone should read AAP\'s official position on circumcision. I was part of a group that collected some of the data and I saw first-hand the VERY heated debate within the medical community. People were called names, religious debates came into play, a lot of heavy, heavy emotions played into both sides who used data to support their preconceived notions. Here\'s the basic analysis of what they say and my rebuttal to the points: TL;DR of their position: preventive health benefits of elective circumcision of male newborns outweigh the risks of the procedure. These supposed health benefits:  significant reductions in the risk of urinary tract infection in the first year of life. So a procedure that\'ll stay with you for a lifetime results in significant reductions in UTI in the first year of life. This is as opposed to teaching parents how to wash a penis, the thing we evolved to have and clean for millenia. in the risk of heterosexual acquisition of HIV and the transmission of other sexually transmitted infections. This one is actually true. I\'ve seen the HIV infect a person and there\'s a coding mechanism that checks the gender of the victim prior to infection. Either that or, well, again, practice safe sex and clean your penis!  That\'s it. Those are the benefits. Let\'s continue with their statement:  The procedure is well tolerated when performed by trained professionals under sterile conditions with appropriate pain management.  Which often doesn\'t happen in Jewish communities where the medical procedure isn\'t done by a doctor and isn\'t that sterile. I know because I witnessed one first-hand not to mention various news reports of babies contracting herpes because the mohel (person conducting the circumcision) sucking out the blood of a baby\'s penis with their mouth (I am not kidding). Appropriate pain management was to put a fingertip into wine and let the baby suckle it with the circumcision following within a minute.  Male circumcision performed during the newborn period has considerably lower complication rates than when performed later in life.  This is true but that goes for many other types of operations. For instance, why not perform female genital mutilation Type Ia which is - biologically - removal of the same tissue. I bet there will be similar UTI benefits. Oh right, huge outcry in the US against FGM but not so much against MGM.  Although health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns  Key statement here and this was a compromise with the "intact" side (i.e. anti-circumcision).  the benefits of circumcision are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it and to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns  This is the compromise with the other side. Basically, male circumcision is not serious enough to warrant a ban and it should depend on the parents on whether to do it or not. This was one of the key points of the debate within the medical community. In the past, say in the 1950s, the doctor recommended the procedure and, since everyone was a Christian, nobody said anything against it. Now the change was the parents had to initiate the request with the doctor performing it. Very politically motivated for obvious reasons that deal more with legal rather than ethical decisions. You can see it later in the statement too:  Parents ultimately should decide whether circumcision is in the best interests of their male child. They will need to weigh medical information in the context of their own religious, ethical, and cultural beliefs and practices.   I.e. parents should make the decision. Valid medical reasons for male circumcision There actually ARE valid, medical reasons for male circumcision which involve the foreskin being too tight. Considering difficulty urinating, increased chance of UTI due to poor cleaning (because of difficulties reaching the area), male circumcision is sometimes needed. If you can\'t retract the foreskin to clean the area, you could have serious medical problems down the line. So, like most medical conditions, there is a valid side to the story. More serious case (NSFW). Parental rights In all this debate, people forget that parents are the legal guardians of the baby. As such, they are the ones who are making the decisions and it\'s best if they\'re informed. For instance, if there\'s a medical reason, they should do it but if there isn\'t, hopefully they\'ve had this conversation before and made a decision. I wouldn\'t want doctors pushing parents into the medical procedure, particularly if there\'s a religious element involved - it\'s not up to the doctors to do that. If parents want to do this then, unfortunately, it\'s on them. Parents make other life-changing decisions and this is simply one of those decisions. It\'s not child abuse if they make a decision we don\'t agree with. That\'s just the sad reality of the situation. If the procedure had NO medical benefits then I\'d say it should be banned and it would be child abuse but considering the position of urologists - and there is some medical merit here - then I can\'t say it\'s child abuse even if I don\'t agree with it. Summary In summary, there is a heated debate in the medical community about this procedure. I think in the decades to come, we\'ll see a shift considering the number of circumcisions continue to drop (likely due to higher rates of non-religious people) and lack of stigma about intact penises. There are some minor medical reasons where male circumcision is necessary so the procedure will become restricted until a doctor signs off on the diagnosis but until then, we can continue the good fight. Parents are indeed the caretakers of the child from an ethical and legal standpoint and should make the decisions. However, I think that doctors should discourage permanent solutions to mostly temporary problems and educate new parents on how to clean a penis properly. The risks don\'t outweigh the benefits in my book or we might as well start cutting off other body parts as well.',
			'My understanding is it is a very minor decrease in the already low chances of transmitting certain diseases, ditto for UTIs. Not enough to justify removing every child\'s foreskin at birth anyway (which in itself can have complications).

			'ockquote> child themselves has rights separate to those of the parents.  Not for medical treatment. Legal guardians have complete say over medical treatment of their dependents. Its why parents can refuse vaccines for their children or take their child off life support.

Killed a US soldier with a homemade grenade he made when he was 16. His father was the chief bomb maker for Al\'Qaeda and had been working with them for decades. Suffice to say... potentially a very dangerous man. Canada would not take him back unless a military court ruled him guilty with him admitting a guilty plea. He would them be shipped off to Canadian maximum security until they can decide whether or not he is a threat to society. He was released six months later with a bracelet and after six more months there were no restrictions on him. But a lot of countries were wanting money to take their citizens back. There are a very high number of Afghan people born in Iran who are denied citizenship. Edit: and shipping them to the US justice system would be bad because you know they were in a black site prison for a decade illegally.',

While in CIA custody, he was flown to Afghanistan, where he was held at a black site and routinely interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomized, and subjected to other cruel forms of inhumane and degrading treatment and torture. After El-Masri held hunger strikes, and was detained for four months in the "Salt Pit," the CIA finally admitted his arrest and torture were a mistake and released him. He is believed to be among an estimated 3,000 detainees whom the CIA has abducted from 2001–2005. In May 2004, the U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Daniel R. Coats, convinced the German interior minister, Otto Schily, not to press charges or to reveal the program. El-Masri filed suit against the CIA for his arrest, extraordinary rendition and torture. In 2006, his suit El Masri v. Tenet, in which he was represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), was dismissed by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, based on the U.S. government\'s claiming the state secrets privilege. The ACLU said the Bush administration attempted to shield its abuses by invoking this privilege. The case was also dismissed by the Appeals Court for the Fourth Circuit, and in December 2007, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. On December 13, 2012, El-Masri won an Article 34 case at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. The court determined he had been tortured while held by CIA agents and ruled that Macedonia was responsible for abusing him while in the country, and knowingly transferring him to the CIA when torture was a possibility. It awarded him compensation. This marked the first time that CIA activities against detainees was legally declared as torture. The European Court condemned nations for collaborating with the United States in these secret programs. [...] After his release, in 2006 El-Masri wrote in the Los Angeles Times that, while held by the CIA in Afghanistan, he was beaten and repeatedly interrogated. He also said that his custodians forcibly inserted an object into his anus. He was kept in a bare, squalid cell, given only meager rations to eat and putrid water to drink. ',

They genuinely feel that some, most, maybe even all of the people who are there actually do have links to terrorism. That they are legitimately a threat. So start with that assumption. I know that you and I disagree with that, but to understand this you\'re going to need to start from that point of view. Now with that assumption in mind, closing this base would mean you have only a few choices... First, you could move them to prisons in the United States. The problem with this is that we are a nation of laws that would require there to be evidence. Evidence that you may not be able to provide to the extent that are Law requires it. Again it\'s very tempting here to just wave this away and say "well if they don\'t have evidence then they should let them go"... If you\'re genuinely trying to understand this mindset, don\'t fall back to this. They genuinely do believe that the people involved are guilty, there just may not be enough evidence to conclusively prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt. As such, moving them to the US isn\'t an option. As an alternative you could move them to countries that have different laws and will keep them in prison on your behalf. However as this is a hot-button issue not many countries are lining up to do us a favor. Finally, you could just release them... But again, go back to that original assumption. Imagine that you had captured all of the hijackers from 9/11 before their attack, you are one hundred percent positive that these people were going to kill countless Americans and you understood the full scope of their plan.... Only you can\'t prove it. If it helps to picture this, imagine you went back in time and literally knew the future, you knew these were literally the people who performed the terrorist attack that you watched happen, but since you prevented it from happening you can\'t prove it. It would be very difficult for you to concede that you should release them. ... The key to this is genuinely believing these people\'s guilt. And honestly, there are probably many/some of them there who genuinely do have links to terrorism. And that\'s where we end up with the complication. How many terrorists would we let go to avoid having free people locked up? Again, my 9/11 from the future example is over the top but that serves as a tangible example because real terrorist attacks are real threats.  There were 19 hijackers on 9/11. If I sent you back to the year 2000 with a list of 40 names, would you put them all in prison to avoid the attack happening?  This is more than mined set of the people involved. And helps explain why it is more of the gray area without a simple answer. I know where I personally stand on the issue, but understanding the other viewpoints from their own place of logic is important. ...

But if they\'re ever going to invent something that\'s able to record sound waves without the use of written language, then individuals need to 1) live for a long time, 2) be very adamant about passing on all of their knowledge to their children, 3) have a really good memory, lol.',
			'That just requires you to expand what you mean by “written”.  For example they could use some sort of tactile writing (like braille) or audio recording (Maybe even as primitives they could drag a stick across the “writing” and discern meaning from the sound) It seems a fair assumption that they would have some way of recording and relating information before inventing space travel, though I suppose if they have some sort of telepathy and/or extremely long life spans oral only (or whatever) communication could work.',
			'Well, your best shot depends on the fact that they presumably understand math at the very least, and so you\'d be able to communicate on those lines, even if it\'s a bit harder if they don\'t have a written language. The hard part is figuring out how they do communicate, whether it\'s electrical impulses, chemical scents, or sexy dance fighting, but from there it\'s doable. If they can figure out that we have vocal cords and written communication, then they might get there first. ',

			'no WTO is just a trade mediation format, where the structure exists for nations to negotiate trade based of the predetermined rules that the nations had to agree to upon entering. WTO dosenèt require free trade amongst countries, it is just a format to negotiate and enforce trade deals. The Americans have been very bad at adhering to the rules that they pretty much wrote as both ideas were theirs to begin with.  When I say Americans I mean American foreign policy, which actually stays pretty consistent across presidencies. ',

You can learn a lot about humanity by spending a day at the playground. ',

At the top of society is the horrible truth - we can\'t influence others without power, and another nation can only leverage power through economic or militaristic means.  How does one nation stop another from ripping off patented inventions or rigging markets? Do we:  "let it happen and wish it didn\'t" Enact trade embargoes and tariffs with the countries that allow it Go to war to stop it  Right now, most nations settle for option 1, members of the WTO and NAFTA etc shoot for 2.

			'Ironically the USA has objected in the WTO (successfully) when India decided to have a requirement for local materials to be used under a government solar power scheme. We think it\'s unfair if you do this, but we will do it also!',
			'It\'s a fair question. The article says if the WTO rules in favor of Taiwan, then the United States must let Taiwan impose its own tariffs on products we export to them, and D.C. has up to 3 years to respond.',
			'This is not even remotely close to what is happening. WTO rules state that if a country believes another country is unfairly imposing benefits to certain sectors then they can compensate their own. So, if China or India is unfairly helping their industries domestically, who then export goods at an advantage, then the US can impose its own \'benefits\' to its industry to compensate. This is rule in place to prevent countries from subsidizing domestic industry to intentionally destroy another countries market. Taiwan is saying that the US rule is a drag net that unfairly impacts them so the WTO must allow them to balance the ledger so to speak. What is happening is literally written in as a rule. Mediation hasn\'t even taken place yet, it\'s an entirely different aspect. Countries are always allowed to dispute things, it\'s basically a pillar of the WTO. Every country is expected to do what is in their best interest, including the US. They haven\'t done anything against WTO rules, I have no idea what the problem is here. You can expect the United States to be very aggressive about solar technology. It is not something that it can control like oil and gas refinement. Countries like India and China have big advantages in manufacturing them, they can do it for cheaper and faster. They can potentially control the market of a big game changing energy technology sector. The US is not going to freely allow India and China to dictate the price and quality of solar panels. Like it or not, this is behavior from the US is totally expected.',
			'You are missing the point that they have been ruled against several times through WTO. They used WTO rules to punish India for doing the exact same thing they are doing now. This is litigious and petty for the largest economy in the world, to go around blowing and sucking at the same time.  WTO one of the pillars in the world order that US made post Bretton Woods. Other nations will look for other institutions to join, if they do not adhere to the rules,their spirit, resort back to big gun diplomacy. China has created plenty institutions and adding members like mad.',

For comparison, Hanwha (another German manufacturer) stopped shipping to the US temporarily because of the price volatility and market uncertainty. Solarworld\'s sales have increased dramatically and are now being forced down our throats by our suppliers. There was a huge back door deal that happened here that\'s going to result in extending the return on investment for the end user, and ultimately hurt the US solar market.

The penalties are somewhat lower than those announced by the department earlier this year, when the government determined that Chinese companies were benefiting from unfair government subsidies and were selling their products in the United States below the cost of production, a practice known as dumping.  NYTIMES: U.S. Will Place Tariffs on Chinese Solar Panels: Oct 12, 2012  The Commerce Department began closing a chapter in a protracted trade conflict with China over solar equipment Tuesday, approving a collection of steep tariffs on imports from China and Taiwan. The decision, intended to close a loophole that had allowed Chinese manufacturers to avoid tariffs imposed in an earlier ruling by using cells — a major module component — made in Taiwan, found that the companies were selling products below the cost of manufacture and that the Chinese companies were benefiting from unfair subsidies from their government.

This duty alone will do little to nothing to create new manufacturing jobs because the US does not subsidize solar enough to lower the kW/h price to make it compete more than it already is with alternative forms of energy and this just makes it worse. This duty will raise the cost of solar kW/hr and without any incentives on manufacturing, and since none have been announced and this admin clearly isn\'t making that a priority, then the result will be less solar usage due to higher cost and a net loss of jobs because they will be fewer and smaller installations.

We need a complete overhaul of both systems to the benefit of the farmer and the consumer. ',
			'Interesting that no-one freaked out when obama did the same thing, in addition to starting his government-funded solyndra to stomp out competition.',
			'Solyndra was essentially a “response” to China. The reason Obama and Trump want sanctions on Solar is because China subsidizes its solar industry, allowing companies to sell at cost. Solyndra was an attempt to nurture a viable alternative to imported Chinese tech that wouldn’t unduly harm consumers. It wasn’t a way to “stomp out” competition, it was a way to encourage people to buy U.S. panels instead.',
			'ockquote> China subsidizes its solar industry  Exactly in the same manner does US also subsidize industries making competition impossible, so it is business as usual.  It wasn’t a way to “stomp out” competition, it was a way to encourage people to buy U.S. panels instead.  EXACTLY why Trump continued with same tariff method as obama. But unlike obama he wants to allow free market competition, not picking a winner run by his friends.',
			'Obama\'s wasn\'t as high either. It was only enough to make up the difference. Not some random number that pops in his head',
			'Obama did tariff + shelling out free money to "state owened" production so no-one else could capitalize on the potential gains. Trump only does tariff. Much more fair.',

			'You\'re right, it is even worse. Have state pay the money without having ownership. Private people milk all the money out from the business and then declare it bankrupt. When in reality with the amounts of money they got it should have been able to continue for decades.',

			'Tearing down free trade where disadvantageous is really the only thing I could agree with Trump on. I\'m interested in seeing whether this actually helps our solar manufacturing or if it\'s more beneficial to the oil industry that Trump is in bed with.',
			'There\'s a pretty good analysis here. To summarize, domestic manufacturers won\'t be able to meet demand within the foreseeable future, and there\'s still no financial incentive for foreign manufacturers to establish new operations in USA, and that in turn will negatively affect jobs because manufacturing operations are largely automated, and due to reduced foreign supply installers and related-jobs will suffer with a lower supply on hand.',
			'Except China is already building a new manufacturing facility in America....',
			'Really? I\'m waiting for the rest of the world to unilaterally declare a trade war on the US. The US is big, but it\'s only 25% of the world economy. If everyone teams up on you guys, you\'re screwed.',

			'Not when all your companies are willing to produce abroad if cheaper.',
			'Right, so we retaliate with something the US doesn\'t manufacture, but can\'t do without, like iPhones. The goal is not too cripple, its to get them to back down on isolationist and potentially illegal tarrifs. ',
			'"Illegal tarrifs", LOL. Man.',
			'ockquote> only 25%  Hahah ',
			'Good for solar manufacturers, horrible for solar panel installers.',
			'ockquote> Tearing down free trade where disadvantageous  Free trade is mutually beneficial.',
			'The idea here is that China is subsidising the solar panels they build, meaning they can sell them below cost. That\'s a competitive advantage no US company has. Because the Chinese panels are so cheap, people will buy those and US companies will bankrupt. That\'s not beneficial to the US. It\'s good for customers in the short run, but once the Chinese get that monopoly they can increase the prices again. Trump is probably doing this to protect the coal industry, which is stupid. But the tariffs themselves I can understand. The other idea is to very heavily subsidise US companies, which may be better but is also very expensive.',
			'ockquote> That\'s not beneficial to the US.  That depends. If China is "unfairly" investing in solar panels, why is the US even competing in that particular field? Renewables is a vaste enterprise, with many different possibilities. If China is kicking the US into the dirt in terms of solar panels, why doggedly remain on that path, when they could invest more in wind, hydrogen, nuclear, wave, etc...? It makes no sense, from a business point of view.  What\'s more, the EU produces a fair quantity of solar panels, but instead of relying on quantity and price, they are selling quality. Not everything has to be the cheapest for the lowest denominator. You can make an absolutely shitton of money, and own a ridiculous market share, by offering higher quality, more technical goods for other applications.  It\'s good for customers in the short run, but once the Chinese get that monopoly they can increase the prices again.  Why would they increase the prices? Like I said above, China isn\'t the only country making solar panels, and its key value is not the quality of its product, but the cheap cost. If it increases the cost, it looses its market edge, and then ends up being a less reliable version of a non-Chinese solar panel.  The other idea is to very heavily subsidise US companies, which may be better but is also very expensive.  The best solution is to do a mix of both. Otherwise, tariffs will just increase the price in the short-term for US customers, without dealing with the fundamental problem (that the EU and China are taking the leading role in solar energy production, and the US is lagging behind). Just tariffs is putting a plaster over a gaping wound. ',
			'The EU implemented 28% tariffs on Chinese panels in 2017',
			'ockquote> Why would they increase the prices?  presumably the subsidy would end someday...',
			'One would think that the economies of scale and increased automation could combat that increase. ',
			'Let them subsidise. If the Chinese taxpayer is paying for your energy, you are better off. Monopolies can only be sustained by continuous government intervention. The minute that China ends their subsidies, savvy American entrepreneurs will grab a low interest loan and start snapping up profits from right underneath the Chinese. China will not have a monopoly for long enough to cause significant damage, only short term inconvenience. There are 0 recorded cases where a monopoly has survived in the long term simply by undercutting it\'s competitors and then jacking up prices afterwards. They always fall. Also China only makes 21% of the solar cells imported into the USA so they have a very long way to go.',
			'You are aware that we passed tariffs on solar panels from China in 2012 and 2014 at similar rates? China responded by moving the last leg of production outside of mainland China. Care to guess where they set up shop? Malaysia, 30% according to your sources. Edit: The EU also has tariffs on solar panels from China, Taiwan and Malaysia.',
			'There are literally 0 examples of predatory pricing working. Hell of a lot of examples of it failing though. Just look at how Herbert Dow made his millions. If China is subsidising their companies, the US benefits. The Chinese taxpayer is paying for America\'s energy needs. The EU isn\'t exactly known for its economic prowess, is it? Last I checked they had a bunch of financial crises happening and everyone was trying to get out. Not a path we should be following.',
			'ockquote> The EU isn\'t exactly known for its economic prowess, is it? Last I checked they had a bunch of financial crises happening and everyone was trying to get out. Not a path we should be following.  Is that so? Well then: The EU Is Not Happy About Trump’s New Tariffs And interestingly enough, the arguments they are presenting here, are strikingly similar to yours.',
			'Well the Eu is actually going fine at the minute. Britain is the only one interested to leave and for largely emotional reasons rather then financial ones. We currently have better economic growth than the USA. Having said that our policy on solar panel imports is also regressive and stupid - Trust Trump to pick the worst policy we have to copy.',
			'There are no "companies" in China. Every thing is operated in part by members of the ruling party. When China has a monopoly on solar panels they will use that as a political ammunition.',
			'The issue is that if all you want is one-sided or severely stilted deals, that will without a doubt isolate you. However, his actions risk marking the US as a fickle and unreliable negotiating partner. The reason why these countries are bringing this up is because it disrupts the negotiated balance of these agreements. US companies benefit greatly from tariff-free markets, but to deny that to partners is exploitative. Free trade on the whole is massively beneficial to the US. Tearing down specific instances where others benefit makes the trade no longer free and is something we have successfully argued in the WTO many times before. The Obama administration was very skilled at this trade bureaucracy litigation. My worry is that Trump\'s boisterous and narcissistic nature will not help in these types of tactful processes.',
			'If solar energy is good, which it is (because it is not only clean but also cheap), and the governments of India and China and other countries are subsidizing the cost to the benefit of U.S. consumer, then what is trump\'s problem? Oh wait, the coal lobby. And the oil lobby. And that Obama called solar good. ',
			'ockquote> And that Obama called solar good.  The Obama administration passed tariffs on Chinese solar panels in 2012 and 2014. Similar rates too.',
			'Because it has bankrupted all solar manufacturing in the U.S. Even a government funded one called Solera. Obama tried to pass similar tarrifs to protect Solera.',
			'ockquote> Even a government funded one called Solera. Obama tried to pass similar tarrifs to protect Solera.  Solyndra failed because their products are CIGS thin film solar cells. CIGS are made with copper, indium, gallium and selenide. After the sharp fall in silicon prices, they simply couldn\'t compete with the conventional solar panels made with silicon. You should probably stop spreading rumors out of context. ',
			'Trump just doing his best to protec my solar city stocks',
			'Got to love that Trumps first steps in protecting American jobs is to go after the solar panel industry. Its almost like he was trying prop a dying coal industry or something…. ',
			'BUILD YOUR SHIT HERE OR SHUT UP.',
			'So China subsidizing solar production so the price is below cost is bad but the US subsidizing the cost of dairy so the price is below cost is good. Ok, got it.',
			'America is such a ratbag "shithole". Their decline is palpable. ',
			'BREAKING: Chinese subsidies being countered by US tariffs. Maybe China should end their subsidies which allow panels to be sold for equal to or less than cost. ',

Mueller denies it.   Another potential conflict claim is an allegation that Mueller and Trump National Golf Club in Northern Virginia had a dispute over membership fees when Mueller resigned as a member in 2011, two White House advisers said. A spokesman for Mueller said there was no dispute when Mueller, who was FBI director at the time, left the club. ',
			'So Mueller could see into the future that he would be able to get revenge on Trump six years later over golf fees. How the fuck does this orange buffoon come up with these crazy stories.',

			'Not sure if this was the cost when Meuller joined but  Members pay an initial fee of $100,000 and a monthly fee of $698, he said.  And  The Washington Post reported that the dispute was hardly a dispute at all. According to a person familiar with the matter, Mr Mueller had sent a letter requesting a dues refund in accordance with normal club practice and never heard back.  So he resigned from the golf club but reasons were not given. He asked for his dues back, I assume this is the monthly amount, but never heard back. If it was the monthly amount if could be anywhere from $698 to around eight thousand (assuming monthly dues are paid in annually).  If he was asking for part of the hundred thousand back, I would think there would be more than just an ignored letter. More than likely it was a lot less than $100k back then.  He is getting paid $160k as a special prosecutor whereas he was making a million a year as a lawyer. That would be a hell of a grudge to give up that salary. ',

I recognise it could be a bit inflammatory so I want to be clear up front I am not asking this as a loaded question, and I\'d really appreciate any responses that can just provide an answer or insight without resorting to insults etc. That being said; as a European, it appears like there is a increasingly huge amount of evidence appearing to show that Trump has a lot of ties to Russia.  Obviously the level and scope of this is debatable. At one end of the scale there seems to be some suggestion that (as with this story) there has been political collusion. Even at the thin end of the wedge it seems there is significant Russian investment in Trump businesses. Certainly from an outsider\'s perspective, Trump supporters are generalised as very pro-American, patriotic nationalists who chose to support Trump in order to focus on America internally and \'make it great again\'.  This tends to manifest (at least how it is shown to us) as wanting to create more of an isolationist attitude towards foreign policy, in particular putting natural-born Americans before those moving to the country in terms of jobs and benefits etc. Also there tends to be a focus in these people on capitalist values over socialist values. For example, they don\'t support universal healthcare. Given issues like the Cold War, the focus against socialism and general historical attitudes, most non-Americans would presume that of all foreign powers, Russia should be the one that would bother older Patriotic Americans the most. So my question is, why is this evidence of close ties between the President and Russia not causing more concern for Trump supporters? I would have thought given their profiles they would have been the first group to actually show concern about it, but currently most seem to (at least) turn a blind eye to it.',
			'It\'s because media tries to create ties even where none exist. This is business as usual, Russians met with American intelligence counterparts, just as they, Russians, meet with European counterparts. If we don\'t talk to adversaries that results in war. I was always Democrat, but the way that DNC stole nomination from Sanders upset me and pushed me to be more Constitutionalist. I call BS from both sides and dislike both parties so when it comes to voting I abstained from voting for either Evil.  I do however see right through all the propaganda of both sides witch hunts etc. they should focus on running the country instead of how to make each other look bad. I\'m European immigrant who is US citizen and I actually defend Trump from stupid stuff like this article that paints incorrect picture. Russia does bother me, but what also bothers me was that all those Democrats who were trying to say Russia was innocent during cold war are now out there with pitch forks.',

It can help with labour shortages, in the UK our building trade was helped by Polish workers and much of our aftercare for health is done by migrants.  It helps with temp jobs, for example if there was a labour shortage of a seasonal job like the tourist industry workers are free to fill those jobs and then return home. This is somewhat common in the UK among wait staff and other kitchen workers, I am assuming its used more than that but I am not an expert.  It allows countries to fill jobs quickly that would require long term training. Say we have a nursing shortage (which we fuckin will post Brexit) rather than wait for years to train nurses migrant workers can fill those roles.  Some countries labour force wont do undesirable jobs, bit like some jobs filled my Mexican/Latin Americans in the States.  The further west you go in the Europe the larger problem we have with an aging population and a low birth rate. Free movement has and will help that.  Something a bit harder to tie to a monetary or workforce gain is that free movement of people in theory lets us travel amongst our brothers and sisters, you are less likely to go to war or support a war with a country you have worked in and met the people.  Obviously there are flaws and problems with free movement, and honestly terror is not in my top 3. ',

In regions where women are forced to wear this, it is in essence an oppressive garment that serves the very system that western women and some eastern are trying to flee while seeking their own autonomy and independence from the traditionalist shackles rooted in religion and dogma. Wear it if you want but no woman should be hurt or killed for wanting to show a little or a lot of extra skin.',

What difference does it make to you? Better yet, what difference does it make to the state? It\'s cultural. Something they might embrace, but I don\'t have to. Rastafarians like to have long dreadlocks. Thats the way they want to look, and I certainly don\'t care what someone else wants to look like.',

The difference is, if they choose to take it off they\'re privately punished. If the state forces them to take it off, the women are not held accountable ',

Is it not \'her\' right and responsibility to decide otherwise after observing drastic cultural differences - of course indoctrination at this point will hinder view changes - but can we do more?

It sets a precedent that "good" women wear the veil and loose women don\'t and thus by many countries islamic standards the unveiled woman is "asking for it".

			'in case anyone is unaware, the 2014 study referenced was a sort of last ditch attempt to avoid the discovery of the so called defeat devices, by "proving" that the anomalous results attained by US agencies emissions testing was down to the testing process itself or equipment used, and not due to the car itself, as various agencies had been in communication with VW in trying to fix the problem. VW, BMW and(I think Mercedes) paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for a study to be done (originally calling for human test subjects riding bicycles to prove no respiratory effects) comparing the exhaust fumes from a new "clean diesel" beatle or Passat (cant remember) to an old F250, by running the engines for hours on end and pumping the exhaust fumes into chambers filled with monkeys. the monkeys were then taken to a lab and had their lung tissues, blood NOx concentration etc measured and compared. upon finding out the study was paid for big car companies, and seeing the results, the researchers essentially cancelled the study and refused to let the big car companies stand behind the "its clean, honestly!" excuse. Edit: so im going to explain a little more about this system after seeing the comment below from /u/xmt447 regarding the Germans turning a blind eye to this. In Europe, car laws and and standards are passed federally, across the whole union, but is enforced by the states. due to each nation being sovereign in its own right, a car can be certified in one country, under that country\'s laws, and providing this is within EU specification, it is then legal in all EU member states. This allows manufacturers of various products to essentially be able to "shop around" so to speak for favourable legislation. Under German law, there is a consumer protection exemption for the emissions requirements, which state that defeat devices may be used should not following them lead to engine damage. Imagine if a brand new diesel particulate filter came out that meant your engine broke down every 30,000 miles. Who would buy that car? Car manufacturers use this as a loophole, claiming that all of their engines longevity is reduced by following the emissions standards. since the car without the defeat device enabled passes emissions testing, it is federally legal. it does what is is supposed to The car is then able to use the defeat device within the EU, since it is allowed by german law. The difference being, that in Europe the cars are taking advantage of a loophole (which admittedly shouldn\'t exist.) but in the States, they were actively cheating the emissions testing.',

			'Puerto Ricos government is awful. It would be easy to blame trump here but the reality is this Mayor is an incompetent buffoon.',
			'As a Puerto Rican, it angers me that some people are blaming Trump and the federal government for the "lack of help". They given us huge amounts of aid, sent workers to help the local electrical entities to repair the infrastructure, etc.  The real problem here is the incompetent and corrupted government. Due to the two main parties bickering with each other: 1) Huge amounts of money that could\'ve been used for services that citizens could benefit from were lost/stolen by the politicians throughout the years.  2) Infrastructure was not updated. The electrical system of Puerto Rico is decades behind, around 50 years old compared to today\'s standards. If the slightest of care went to improve this, the recovery wouldn\'t be as bad as it is now.  3) Certain politicians, from both sides, are disgustingly using the disaster to make themselves look good for their next election campaign. Take the mayor of San Juan for example. Instead of helping her own people, she\'s running around doing tours while blaming Trump and the Feds. For those who are gullible, the image they see from this is "Wow, she\'s not afraid to speak up and tell the truth. What a strong woman that can be a viable candidate for governor."

			'I\'m just going to excerpt a couple of news stories at you. Story #1:  Lost weekend: How Trump’s time at his golf club hurt the response to Maria Abby Phillip, Ed O\'Keefe, Nick Miroff and Damian Paletta Washington Post, September 29, 2017 At first, the Trump administration seemed to be doing all the right things to respond to the disaster in Puerto Rico. As Hurricane Maria made landfall on Wednesday, Sept. 20, there was a frenzy of activity publicly and privately. The next day, President Trump called local officials on the island, issued an emergency declaration and pledged that all federal resources would be directed to help. But then for four days after that — as storm-ravaged Puerto Rico struggled for food and water amid the darkness of power outages — Trump and his top aides effectively went dark themselves. Trump jetted to New Jersey that Thursday night to spend a long weekend at his private golf club there, save for a quick trip to Alabama for a political rally. Neither Trump nor any of his senior White House aides said a word publicly about the unfolding crisis. Trump did hold a meeting at his golf club that Friday with half a dozen Cabinet officials — including acting Homeland Security secretary Elaine Duke, who oversees disaster response — but the gathering was to discuss his new travel ban, not the hurricane. Duke and Trump spoke briefly about Puerto Rico but did not talk again until Tuesday, an administration official said. [...] Trump’s public schedule Monday was devoid of any meetings related to the storm, but he was becoming frustrated by the coverage he was seeing on TV, the senior official said. At a dinner Monday evening with conservative leaders at the White House, Trump opened the gathering by briefly lamenting the tragedy unfolding in Puerto Rico before launching into a lengthy diatribe against Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) over his opposition to the Republicans’ failed health-care bill, according to one attendee. After the dinner, Trump lashed out on social media. He blamed the island’s financial woes and ailing infrastructure for the difficult recovery process. He also declared that efforts to provide food, water and medical care were “doing well.” On the ground in Puerto Rico, nothing could be further from the truth. It had taken until Monday — five days after Maria made landfall — for the first senior administration officials from Washington to touch down to survey the damage firsthand. And only after White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert and FEMA Director Brock Long returned to Washington did the administration leap into action.  Trump presided over a Situation Room meeting on the federal and local efforts Tuesday, and late in the day, the White House added a Cabinet-level meeting on Hurricane Maria to the president’s schedule.  Puerto Rico got hit by a category 5 hurricane, and the White House tuned it out. Here\'s a second, just as damning story:  The Military Was Ready in Texas and Florida. What Went Wrong in Puerto Rico? By RICHARD PARKER Politico, October 02, 2017 Nearly two weeks after Hurricane Maria’s landfall, the Trump administration’s military aid to Puerto Rico may not be too late if it can save lives and ease the suffering of millions. But it is undisputedly arriving in amounts too little and too slowly, in sharp contrast to recent responses around the world and, most recently, elsewhere in the United States during this hurricane season. Over the past few years, the military has conducted textbook operations in Pakistan, Japan, Thailand and Haiti—pumping in massive amounts of aid after devastating earthquakes and hurricanes in those countries, no matter how rough or isolated the conditions. Just weeks ago, the military response to Hurricane Harvey in Texas was rapid and powerful. In preparation for Hurricane Irma, the Trump administration again ordered up an extensive military relief operation. But when Hurricane Maria struck at full strength several days later—precisely as advertised, and similar in scale to Harvey—the U.S. military simply called off the huge resources it had mustered for Hurricane Irma. An inadequately small military contingent was left on its own for nearly two weeks to help with the damage. If there was a plan for disaster relief it was not publicly apparent. And on-scene commander—crucial in crises this large—was not appointed until nearly 10 days after landfall.  [...] On August 31, the Kearsarge and company headed for the Texas Gulf Coast—six full days after Hurricane Harvey made its own devastating landfall. That might seem late, but the saving grace, of course, was that other military assets reached Texas first. Indeed, Hurricane Harvey in Houston provided a preview of how the military normally responds to humanitarian disasters. Within six days, military search and rescue filled the skies, as HH-60s flew overhead while C-130s and 17 giant C-17 and two C-5 cargo planes from as far away as Utah and New York, ferried in supplies—despite closed civilian airports. The Coast Guard alone flew in 42 helicopters and seven cargo planes. Medical patients were evacuated to San Antonio. The U.S. Northern Command sent nearly 70 more helicopters. Over 6,000 active duty troops arrived along with 5,000 and then 6,000 more members of the Texas National Guard, maneuvering in nearly 300 high-water trucks, Chinook helicopters and boats. With Hurricane Irma ominously approaching Florida, the Kearsarge and company turned east. The military’s preparations for Irma were as awesome in their scale as they had been for Harvey. Some 8,000 troops of the Florida National Guard were not only activated but, like a wartime army, maneuvered across the state as Irma craftily perplexed forecasters as to where, precisely, it would strike. Other states pitched in thousands of additional guard troops. (All of this information is drawn from Northern Command’s and other public military statements.) At sea and in the air the response built up like a clenched fist. The Kearsarge amphibious group was not only on its way but the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln made for the Keys with the support vessels USS Iowa Jima, New York and San Jacinto. And much of the entire helicopter aviation brigade of the fabled 101st Airborne Division—the world’s largest helicopter army—prepared to deploy, packing its choppers into C-5 cargo planes. The Air Force readied what’s known as an air bridge: A continual flow of big C-17, C-5 and C-130 cargo planes. A U.S. military air bridge can move entire divisions—tanks, 10,000 troops, equipment and all—into combat halfway around the world overnight. This time, though, it would carry 14 million meals, water, fuel and equipment. Indeed, because of the overwhelming response, the Kearsarge was freed up to ferry British marines into the hard-hit British Virgin Islands. But then Irma struck the Keys, spared Miami and spent itself bouncing up Florida’s west coast. And suddenly, the Kearsarge’s group was sailing alone into the Caribbean. It and its sister vessels headed to Dominica to evacuate that devastated island. Wasp stayed, peeled off to the U.S. Southern Command, as the rest of the group headed for Puerto Rico, arriving the day after Maria roared across it and the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands. Kearsarge and Oak Hill were left to put a small advance party ashore in Puerto Rico to assess the situation the day after the storm and set up air traffic control. Helicopter search and rescue operations were launched and supplies were ferried ashore. And everything else? Vanished. The Lincoln and other vessels left their posts in Florida turned back north. After dropping off fresh water in Florida, the Lincoln turned north and made port in Virginia by September 15. National Guard units returned home. The air armada of what would have been hundreds of aircraft and helicopters bound for Irma never appeared after Maria. An Army photographer captured the 101st offloading its helicopters from the C-5s in the dark, even as Maria approached. [...] In the case of Maria, at first blush, three things appear to have not been done. The first is adequately preposition forces and assets. The second is the timely appointment of an on-scene commander; the U.S. Northern Command did not appoint combat veteran Brigadier General Richard Kim until 10 days after landfall. The third is a detailed plan. Planning is paramount, according to the manual. And if there was one, it certainly was not publicly announced as were military relief efforts for Irma and Harvey—even though Maria’s strength and trajectory were known a full four days before landfall. The Trump administration has sought, desperately, to shift the blame and claim that this was somehow a surprise—even though a direct hit was forecast days beforehand. Later, Lieutenant Jeffrey Buchanan, the three-star land forces commander at Northern Command, even claimed that the hurricane’s effect was not foreseeable. Again, suspiciously defensive. If the military didn’t think Maria was serious, then why did it evacuate its own aircraft on the island to Guantanamo Bay?  PS: So pitiyanqui.',
			'To all those reading, sacudim and I are regulars on /r/PuertoRico and he has a heavy anti-trump bias to the point he calls his supporters, or people that praise some of his actions [like me], sub-human filth. So take his comments with a grain of salt.  Response to news story #1 - It criticizes Trump and his administration for "going dark" on the aftermath of the hurricane, which is false. The article even says Trump stated help was going to arrive as soon as possible. How is this "going dark"? Note the hurricane María devastated allcommunication methods. How could Trump say anymore of the situation when communication was scarce doing this period? Information was not being informed.  Another critic is that supplies were slow to arrive. Again, false. For starters, the hurricane destroyed a lot of the poorly constructed roads on the island [attributed to the corrupted government that didn\'t properly use funds to fix them], making the transport of aid more difficult. Second, the local truckers union went on a strike to demand higher pay for transporting goods. You read that right, these disgusting people were seeking profits during a time were many people were in need of help. This went on for a couple of days, until the unionists got what they wanted. Gasoline was one of the goods affected heavily by this.  Lastly, as Trump excellently said, the ailing infrastructure and financial woes affected our recovery process immensely, and whose to blame? The local government. Negating this is very ignorant and intellectually dishonest.  News story #2 is right about one thing: A disaster relief plan was not concrete or apparent. But to blame that on Trump? I\'m not too sure. I believe that falls on the local government or FEMA, take your pick. Why? They are the ones who are supposed to relay all the information: what is needed, what happened, etc. Hurricane María wiped out all communications, so response was expected to be slow.

			'Death-wise nearly 1,000 have died fro the hurricane or from the situation created by it and the lack of care we gave. Katrina\'s final toll was 1,830. Not that close, but nothing to sneeze at.',
			'Actually, it\'s very difficult to compare these numbers, because those are two counts/estimates that were done by very different means.  FiveThirtyEight had a very extensive 2015 article on Katrina\'s death toll. The title is a good hint already: "We Still Don’t Know How Many People Died Because Of Katrina." I\'ll quote some bits deep in the guts of the article:  John Mutter, a geophysicist at Columbia University, was more familiar with earthquakes than hurricanes before Katrina. After the levees failed and the official death counts kept rising, Mutter began looking into it. There had not been a storm with a comparable death toll since 1928, when a hurricane pushed the waters of Florida’s Lake Okeechobee up and over the levees at its southern end, drowning thousands. Mutter was interested in what standards existed for counting how many people were killed by a hurricane. He discovered that there aren’t any. “They made their own,” he said in a telephone interview. [...] Mutter decided to try to improve on the existing counts for Katrina, seeking to include indirect deaths that had never before been linked to the storm. With the help of a grant of around $20,000 from Columbia’s Earth Institute, where he works, Mutter started a website to solicit information about victims. Some of the responses were helpful. But Mutter worried that his site wasn’t reaching the people who were hardest to find: Poorer people who weren’t Internet-savvy and might be suspicious of people asking questions. Mutter is sure the true death toll is higher than the official figures. But he’s not sure of the best way to figure out what it is. He once believed that it was more than 3,500; he now says it likely isn’t above 2,500. That still isn’t the highest estimate. Another effort arrived at a total of more than 4,000 with a method that researchers use to estimate civilian deaths in conflict zones. Mutter ran out of funding in 2010, and his work largely stopped then. But people still send him new names for his count, especially around the time of year that Katrina struck.  And note that the oft-cited New York Times Maria mortality estimate of 1,052 is just from September 20 to October 31, 2017. I still haven\'t seen any newer estimates using November or December data. One key thing to keep in mind is that different hurricanes damage different populations in different ways. Comparing one hurricane\'s effects to another can be like comparing apples to oranges, even if they\'re both technically hurricanes. Katrina was as deadly as it was because it breached the levees and flooded a densely populated city, drowning hundreds of people in the first few days. Harvey was as damaging of property as it was because it poured unprecedented amounts of rain. Like, the National Weather Service literally had to modify their software to add a new color to their rain maps because it was so unprecedented. Maria killed so many people in Puerto Rico not because of its winds or its waters, but because of the extended power outage—which is still ongoing—and failure to help the most vulnerable in the most critical moments. As Puerto Rico\'s Centro de Periodismo Investigativo put it:  The majority of these deaths were men and women over 50 years old who died in hospitals and nursing homes from conditions such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s, kidney disease, hypertension, pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.  And as the New York Times added:  But the highest surge was in deaths from sepsis — a complication of severe infection — which jumped 50 percent over last year. That change is notable and could be explained by delayed medical treatment or poor conditions in homes and hospitals.  So basically, what the Katrina vs. Maria comparison tells us is that breached levees kill lots of people very quickly, while extended blackouts kill lots of people much slower.',

The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years. The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Liana Fiol Matta. The legal system is a mix of the civil law and the common law systems. Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with advice and consent from the Senate.

The point I am trying to make is that the population continuously elects people with little to no formal training on managing anything >to hold top positions and make decisions for the masses.  I am not an expert on the electoral system but I don\'t agree. The overwhelming majority of elected officials have college education at all levels of government. Its rare outside of small scale, rural local governments for "average joe" types to be in charge of anything, and when they are its because they fit that office. For local office you don\'t technically need a lot of education, but those boards are designed to have common citizens serving on them. The board appoints a professional for managing the public entity- a superintendent for a school board, a city manager for a small to medium sized municipality\'s city council. Your friend might not be the worst candidate for school board, what are his other qualifications and did he spend time learning the responsibilities of the office? There is a lot of formal and informal pressure for council or board members to be competent, lest they or the city be sued/entangled in legal challenges.  To be an elected Sheriff or Justice of the Peace generally entails going through police training and becoming an officer, and states usually have criminal justice education centers that they go to for advanced studies so they can do their job. To run for a state or federal office and actually get on the ballot you have to navigate a hierarchical system of party votes and caucuses that gets increasingly complex and elitist as you go up the ladder. At the top, states and federal congress and senate are virtually all lawyers, doctors, and businessmen and typically in their 50s or older. You are never going to get the support needed to run a campaign or be effective with no education, no connections, and no experience in the world of politics. Instead of repeating these cynical myths I\'d open my eyes and have a little more faith in the American political system. It\'s not just Trump.',
			'I actually voted for Trump. I have a BA in CJ and PA. I am now going getting a MBA. I am telling you from first hand experience what I have seen. I went to college for government and understand what education one interested in politics would receive. It is not high level and it does not make anyone qualified to make major decisions or run cities. In fact my PA degree was more geared towards that then a POSC degree was.  This was at a respected state level school. In a perfect world you would be right.... but your wrong.  I agree with the you last paragraph but that is also what I am stating the issue is. People with power and wealth are able to gain power and hold offices they in no means are qualified for. They can be businessmen, lawyers, or doctors but that does not make them good or qualified for what they are doing. CA for the longest time was allowing people to take the bar from "fake garage colleges". This allowed people to become lawyers whom in no way were qualified to be lawyers. Additionally, two people can receive CJ degrees and not have the same level of qualifications. Their are many who I went to school with who achieved degrees in our conveyor belt system which in no way have the qualifications to be a police officer or run a department, let alone be sheriff. You also kind of agreed with what I stated. A lawyer, judge, or doctor should not be in charge of running a city or state. They are not qualified to do this. A prosecutor or doctor do not have experience is strategic planning, disaster planning, or management skills. Running a Lawyers/ Doctors office is completely different from running a city with 200,000+ people ',

Bottled water was in demand, but restaurants and grocery stores were open.  Assuming many employers are still not functioning it is probable that many people are hurting financially. It would be much more effective and efficient to provide them with financial aid to buy regular food in groceries , rather than giving them more cans of chili.  The federal efforts continue in PR.

The revelation comes at a moment when Donald Trump and some Republican lawmakers have been seeking to cast doubt on the credibility of the Mueller inquiry and the motivation of the FBI in examining Russian collusion, including unproven allegations that investigators had a bias in favour of Hillary Clinton when the investigation was initially launched before November. The Republican memo reportedly alleges that the FBI relied on the Steele dossier, which was partly paid for using Democratic funds, in seeking the Carter Page warrant, according to the New York Times.

Read between the lines, wonder about the reason for being told rather than if i\'m being lied to or not.  Because you see, when you just flat out reject authority, when you say these people lie, these people tell the truth, you step out of one bubble and back into another one. You believe you\'re waking up from a world you\'ve been indoctrinated into only to find yourself indoctrinated into another one. You believe everyone is a sheep while you subscribe to another Shepard. You believe you\'re free when you\'re really just a slave in another pen. The question isn\'t "are they telling me the truth, or are they telling me lies", the question is "if I were in their position, why would I be telling me these things. If I were the authority, how would I handle this?" When you look through the world through that perspective you can start to understand that yes, the tree does indeed make a sound when it falls.  There is something called the truth, there is something real, anyone telling you otherwise is trying to muddy the waters.  This isn\'t good v bad, left v right.

If things like these stop being believed, they stop being \'true\'. The laws are fallible and there\'s no reason to believe them inherently moral, nor is there something for morality to be inherently based on. Our current systems may be better than much of what\'s come before, but that doesn\'t make them flawless. People who lived hundreds of years ago, wrote down some profound stuff, then died aren\'t infallible prophets. There isn\'t even a universal way to determine what actions are rational to take, as what is rational will vary entirely based on the perspective of the individual. Every scrap of information we take in is subject to our own interpretation of the way it was presented to us. We can use what facts we get to try and determine as objective a reality as we can get, but we can\'t reach total objectivity. Even given all facts and information, there is no way to determine what is to be done with it and its subjects without bias.

What do you think is going to happen when a political activist tied to the Clinton White House in the 1990\'s comes forward with a memo? The reality is that there is no amount of evidence you could present to these people that would convince them that they\'ve been duped and lied to. There could literally be a video of Donald Trump getting golden showers from prostitutes in a hotel room AND THEN Putin walks in and hands Trump a document labeled "Democratic Party Emails" or some shit, and they\'d still deny it, even though it would all be on tape. Remember, when Russia hacked the DNC, they wanted proof. When proof was provided in the form of of internet protocol details, they claimed it was fake and "not enough". When all of our intelligence agencies released reports detailing how and what Russia did, they said it was fake and didn\'t happen. There is nothing you can say to convince these people they were lied to.

			'I know you jest, but it\'s beginning to look like the Kremlin has serious kompromat on the President of the United States. The quid may have been collusion, the quo may be the administration not moving forward with new sanctions that were passed near unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed by the President.[1] This decisions comes on the same day that CIA Director Mike Pompeo announced that the 2018 U.S. midterm election will be targeted by Russia.[2] To add insult to injury the Treasury Department had been given 6 months to create a list of Russian political figures and Oligarchs and all they produced was a list copied directly from a Russian edition of Forbes billionaire list, further indication that the administration refuses to take sanctions against Russia seriously.[3] This morning a Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the list was taken from Forbes Magazine.[4] These sanctions were passed overwhelmingly by Congress in retaliation for Russia\'s election meddling and human rights abuses.[5] Now back to the topic at hand, we now have two dossiers that allege Trump was compromised during a 2013 trip to Moscow involving lewd activities in a hotel. We also know that long time bodyguard and friend of President Trump testified to Congress that 5 women were offered to Trump while he was in Moscow in 2013.[6]  WASHINGTON — After a business meeting before the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013, a Russian participant offered to "send five women" to Donald Trump\'s hotel room in Moscow, his longtime bodyguard told Congress this week, according to three sources who were present for the interview. Two of the sources said the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, viewed the offer as a joke, and immediately responded, "We don\'t do that type of stuff." ...That night, two sources said, Schiller said he discussed the conversation with Trump as Trump was walking back to his hotel room, and Schiller said the two men laughed about it as Trump went to bed alone. Schiller testified that he stood outside Trump\'s hotel room for a time and then went to bed. One source noted that Schiller testified he eventually left Trump\'s hotel room door and could not say for sure what happened during the remainder of the night.   1) New York Times - Trump Administration Won’t Impose Sanctions on Buyers of Russian Arms 2) BBC - Russia \'will target US mid-term elections\' says CIA chief 3) Bloomberg - The U.S. List of Russian Oligarchs Is a Disgrace 4) The Hill - Administration admits Treasury\'s list of Russian \'oligarchs\' was derived from Forbes 5) New York Times - Congress Reaches Deal on Russia Sanctions, Setting Up Tough Choice for Trump 6) NBC News - Trump Bodyguard Keith Schiller Testifies Russian Offered Trump Women, Was Turned Down',

			'Oh, without a doubt. Bannon\'s comments all but confirmed our suspicions.[1]  [Bannon] “You realise where this is going,” he is quoted as saying. “This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose [senior prosecutor Andrew] Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy.  President Trump said the red line would be drawn at Special Counsel Mueller looking into the Trump Empire\'s finances. Why you may ask? The entire family is involved in laundering money. We recently found out that Trump\'s first international venture in Panama City is a hub for laundering money.[2] He handed the business dealings over to Ivanka Trump and although many properties were bought the entire area is almost a ghost town.[3] The tower stands dark as very few people live in the properties. Turns out the owners hail from colourful backgrounds including Russian gangsters, drug cartels, and people smugglers.[4] Rachel Maddow did a piece about a Trump Tower project in Azerbaijan.[5] In it Ivanka Trump takes a video promoting her family\'s building, but it turns out she wasn\'t filming at the Trump property as it was built in a rundown location.  The Trump organization has been laundering money for a long time. Here are a few examples from The New Yorker including his Taj Mahal Casino, projects in India, Uruguay, Georgia, Indonesia, the Philipines, and China.[6] Listen to this short NPR podcast interview where Adam Davidson explains what he uncovered while investigating Baku.[7]  Christopher Steele has stated that Trump\'s hotel and land deals with Russians need to be examined.[8] Read what Felix Sater, a Russian bussiness associate of the President, offered President Trump\'s personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Felix Sater admits to working with the Kremlin under the guise of building the Trump Moscow Tower to help get Trump elected. Both the New York Times[9] and the Washington Post[10] corroborate this story.   “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Mr. Sater wrote in an email. “I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.” “I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Mr. Sater wrote.  Back in the 90s Felix Sater was caught up in a massive stock scam and flipped on mob families in New York. Guess who flipped him? He\'s on Special Counsel Mueller\'s team - Andrew Weissmann.[11] Felix Sater attended Trump\'s invite-only victory party to celebrate his presidential victory.[12] Although Trump has tried to distance himself from Sater due to his colourful past, I find it very peculiar that he was allowed into an invite-only event at the Midtown Hilton. Moreover, in July of 2016 we know he attended a secret meeting at Trump Tower, no one knows what was discussed.[13] We know Felix Sater has been ready to work with Special Counsel Mueller\'s team.[14] Paul Wood, World Affairs correspondent for the BBC, wrote the original article for The Spectator.[15] Here\'s another example to illustrate my point. Russian Oligarch Rybolovlev bought a Trump property in Palm Beach for $100 million, making it the most expensive property in America. Here\'s the kicker - after buying it Rybolovlev tore it down even though he had just paid $60 million over market price.[16] Where this becomes even more peculiar is that the Russian oligarch\'s private yacht and plane were in the same vicinity as Trump or his associates during the campaign on several separate occasions.[17] For example, Rybolovlev\'s plane landed in North Carolina 2 hours before Trump made his stop there for a campaign rally.[18] Rybolovlev\'s yacht was in Croatia last summer where Ivanka and Kushner were vacationing. Back in March while Rybolovlev\'s yacht was anchored in the British Virgin Islands, Robert Mercer\'s yacht was anchored next to it.[19]   1) The Guardian - Trump Tower meeting with Russians \'treasonous\', Bannon says in explosive book 2) NBC - A Panama tower carries Trump’s name and ties to organized crime 3) Global Witness - Narco-A-Lago: Money Laundering At The Trump Ocean Club Panama 4) The Guardian - Trump\'s Panama tower used for money laundering by condo owners, reports say 5) Sketchy Donald Trump Deal Eyed For Ties To Iran | Rachel Maddow | MSNBC 6) The New Yorker - Donald Trump’s Worst Deal: The President helped build a hotel in Azerbaijan that appears to be a corrupt operation engineered by oligarchs tied to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard 7) NPR - \'The New Yorker\' Uncovers Trump Hotel\'s Ties To Corrupt Oligarch Family 8) Business Insider - \'Dossier\' author Christopher Steele: Trump\'s hotel and land deals with Russians need to be examined 9) New York Times - Trump Associate Boasted That Moscow Business Deal ‘Will Get Donald Elected’ 10) The Washington Post - Trump’s company had more contact with Russia during campaign, according to documents turned over to investigators 11) Slate - An Intriguing Link Between the Mueller Investigation, Trump, and Alleged Money Laundering 12) GQ - Inside Donald Trump\'s Election Night War Room 13) Politico - Trump’s mob-linked ex-associate gives $5,400 to campaign 14) Raw Story - Longtime Trump business partner ‘told family he knows he and POTUS are going to prison’: report 15) The Spectator - Forget Charlottesville - Russia Is Still The True Trump\'s True Scandal 16) McClatchy - Donald Trump and the mansion that no one wanted.

Given the recent influx of news items in the last week (including this one) I\'d say the music is playing very loudly for Carter Page right now, and that is where I\'d have my money ahead of any pee tape',
			'Yep it\'s very clear Putin has a kompromat on Trump. But what I find even more worrying is that there is a big chance the entire GOP is being influenced by the Russians. I mean, we know the RNC was hacked by Russia just like the DNC was, but somehow the information has not been leaked. So, for some reason the information has more value to Putin while it is still private... Meanwhile, I wonder why the GOP is attacking the FBI',
