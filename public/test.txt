Her job is to save those that don\'t have a voice, to get them out, and get them homes. She saved 1700 on her own last year. I\'m pretty sure she cares about animals more than she cares about people.',

			'ockquote> He was stabbed once in the neck  fuckkkkkk that\'s gotta be a horrible way to go',
			'Yes fuck them indeed, but we must also remember that many of the poachers come from very poor conditions and financial situations, and are given an amount of money that could potentially change and/or save their life (not justifiable, but a factor to keep in mind) . The ones who should suck a even bigger willy, is the ones who fund these horrible murders, and the people who buy Ivory. (Looking at you China)  Edit: word',

Police are investigating the circumstances but suspect it was a botched robbery.   Ehm... Botched robbery? That\'s pretty easy to fake. Considering the timing and all, might want to check other angles just in case. (Unless it\'s just a cover for the public, sigh)',

			'I remember spending 2 hours in a government building looking to purchase a topo map for a water project. All the government employees just kept sending us to other people in a circle. As soon as we showed bribe money suddenly everyone knew exactly who had what we needed to get the topo map. Was sad really. Edit: This was in Kisumu in western Kenya.',

			'These people still get paid. They just want more. Corruption and bribery are ways of life there. Have you ever met anyone who grew up in the former Soviet states or satellite states? They\'ll tell you that bribery was not just commonplace, but mandatory if you wanted to get anything done. If you put someone in a position of power and eliminate the consequences of abusing it, then they will quickly begin to take advantage of it. The only reason that (overt and boldfaced) corruption doesn\'t run rampant in every level of government in America is that there are systems of checks and balances. Wrongdoing and abuses of power have to be more subtle if you don\'t want to end up in prison. You take that away, and it would quickly revert back to a culture of "Fuck you, pay me." I mean, look at the DMV. They barely get anything done as is.',
			'What are you talking about.. lobbying is overt and blatant corruption and rampant in US Gov',
			'Though I would tend to agree, that is still just an opinion. Besides, that\'s not really the kind of corruption I\'m referring to. I\'m referring to the kind of corruption where people won\'t do their jobs unless you bribe them, or police and legal authorities harass you unless you bribe them. Do you not realize that in many countries, everyone has to pay bribes? You\'ve probably never had to bribe someone in your entire life, so it\'s hard to imagine just how commonplace it is in every level of government outside of the West.',
			'Yeah but in the West, a government employee would just show you where a map would be. No real need for a bribe there haha.',

			'I lived in a different part of Africa (Mali and Burkina), but most of Sub-Saharan Africa seems to be the same regarding this stuff. If you are driving and a gendarme/policeman motions for you to pull over, you don\'t even slow down. Because first, they have picked you out as a foreigner and intend to demand a bribe; second, those guys don\'t have radios; third, even if they did have a radio, no one would bother to respond; and fourth, you don\'t want to stand around on the side of the road in busy areas, because there\'s always some guy in an ancient delivery truck who accidentally mixed up texts to his wife and girlfriend and is trying to do damage control, and he won\'t even realize he ran you over until he stops, and then he\'ll shake his head and complain about filthy stray animals while he sloshes a bucket of slightly muddy water over the front of his truck and washes away the last evidence you once existed, as the rest of you has been smeared over 14 miles of dirt roads.',

			'There’s a lot of hate being focused on “tracking down and killing the poachers “  The sad truth is most will likely just be trying to feed their families however they can.  To stop trades like this you need to go after the buyers with unreasonably excesses punishment. Think 10 years hard labour for buying ivory or holding a collection of it.  Kill the demand and you kill the trade, it’s too easy to kill an animal that roams an area so vast, policing it is ineffective at the best of times.  Even a death sentence for poachers wouldn’t stop it as the risk reward will simply result in higher pay. Given the disparity between the income of poachers and buyers higher pay for poachers will win out.  Death sentence for ivory owners would do it. ',
			'I doubt that will ever happen. Even going after the user through law has a limited effect. It is already illegal and is used and consumed via the black market like a drug and we know how that has been working out.  They are attacking this issue by removing the supply via cutting horns. And education as well as making it illegal. But there will always be a handful that want it regardless.',

			'As with several other websites I could name, to use facebook you have to reject the algorithm. You can ignore and unfollow people, but IMO it\'s far better to create a friends list with all of the people whose posts you want to see. Going to that friends list shows you what those people have posted and shared IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. No "[friend] liked this" or "[family member] commented on that". No algorithm trying to show you what it thinks you want to see. Just the posts of the people you care about in the order that those posts were made. Once you make this list, make a bookmark so you can go directly to it. Then when you visit facebook, you go to your list, scroll down until you see something you recognize, and you\'re done! Even if you comment a few times, it won\'t take very long. No more endless scrolling.',

This has effectively killed using Facebook for me because I can\'t have a conversation with one of my friends, or post some shitty/witty status update that only my closest buddies would get, without my elderly aunt adding a "like" and weighing in like she knows what the fuck we\'re talking about.

(On one of my pictures he liked) This was years ago and he hasn\'t liked anything I\'ve posted since. I don\'t care about the likes, but I feel bad, like I prob hurt his feelings. It was just a lot at the time I felt like he was blowin up my spot.  We live far away, he was prob enjoying watching what his son was getting up to and wanted to feel like he was interacting.

			'Social media has changed quite a lot over the last few years though. Over the last few years, I see less and less of what people are doing, and more and more of easily digestible image macro and shareable stories. Not to mention, every single brand has a Facebook. So you have a mix of your friends, your family (because EVERYONE has one), brands that you follow, and advertisements. But it is a lot more than that: there\'s also any posts that your friends, family, or brands that you follow comment on, like, share, etc. The algorithm decided that you have too many people and posts to see, so it sorts them by what it thinks you find important. So certain friends and brands slip away behind the algorithm, which in turn causes you to see and Like their stuff less, and eventually are gone, because you never Like their content. Which continues to cycle over and over until they are invisible. So that friend, that you follow, will disappear from your feed and unless you actively search them out, you won\'t ever see what they are up to. Then people realize they are bored with seeing the dame things over and over from the same small group of people, some not realizing their other friends are still posting, they\'re just stuck behind an algorithmic filter. So they leave. Causing this same thing to cycle and cycle and cause less people to be interested, and in turn, less interesting to the filters. I don\'t know, I\'ve had a lot of jumbled thoughts on this. My social media hasn\'t felt very social lately, and none of my close friends use it anymore for any number of reasons, so it\'s a weird mix of knowing it can never go back to the way it was, but also wanting a simpler time of just sharing my thoughts, what I was up to, and seeing the same from friends and even acquaintences, without all the often over-politicized garbage and clickbait from relatives that\'s taken over.',
			'Because I don\'t want my grandma to be able to see and comment on everything I do with my friends, and I don\'t want everyone I\'ve ever met to be able to see what I comment on my aunts pictures, and I don\'t want my boss thinking that I am free advertising for his business.

The only difference between Reddit and the rest though is that you can find quality, anonymous discussions here. Where people aren’t in it to show themselves off but rather communicate and then move on. I also find essentially all my news here and learn a lot of new things.

			'I\'m a big fan of Instagram, people normally like photos and leave it at that without any strange conversations arising. ',
			'It\'s beginning to go downhill. They\'re already showing more ads and Recommended for You posts in your (non-chronological) feed.',
			'God fuck the non-chronological feed. Facebook automatically set your feed to "Top Posts" instead of recent, so I stopped using Facebook. Instagram did the same shit, so now I\'m not using Instagram. I\'ve resorted to texting and calling people I want to interact with like a God damn barbarian. ',
			'Texting I understand, but calling!? What year is it?? /s',
			'Yeah that really grinded my gears. Ads? Yeah fair enough that\'s inevitable. But pushing random crap that the app thinks I will like and engage with just adds to the mindless skip-scrolling that I do with ads. That and the new snapchat update have infuriated me, but snap is a whole new can of beans for another thread.',

			'I\'ve recently deactivated, and it\'s definitely been a good choice. I feel like reddit is better, not neccessarily because I get to see both sides of the aisle, but because I have near constant access to people from around the globe, who offer a different perspective than just my American friends. Not only that, but the entire reddit community is basically my friends list- you\'re not people I\'ve added, you\'re just there by default. We might not always be great with people who express fairly extreme (usually more conservative) opinions, but I find the conversations here are 100x more stimulating. Hell, even when I don\'t join the conversation, reading other people\'s discussions some times spark new ideas, or make me re-evaluate my perspective on the world (and what has lead me to have said perspective)',

			'I just fully logged out of my Facebook account about a month ago, I was feeling so down...I found myself on a Friday or Saturday night witnessing other people out at concerts, dinner, parties etc while I was home all alone. Scrolling through Facebook was causing me to become more and more depressed.  I have noticed that I\'m also more clear headed and productive since logging out of Facebook. I actually spent my Friday and Sunday meeting new people and not feeling like I needed to let Facebook know I had a life by posting a picture of my drink or the restaurant I was at.

		title: 'Finland seeks to abolish Daylight Saving Time from the European Union ',
		ments: [
			'It\'s about time, we need to get rid of it everywhere. It just creates extra confusion with timezones.',
			'ockquote> It\'s about time,  Correct',
			'Great scott!',
			'🎶" it\'s about time, It\'s about space, It\'s about 2 astronauts.... Here for a long long time"🎶🎶',
			'Somebody get bill wurtz on it.',
			'If you have no daylight you don\'t have to worry about daylight saving time.',
			'My vote will always be that we stay on daylight savings year round. Get that extra hour in the evening!',
			'Omg please. I love the sun setting at 8 in the summer and 6 in the winter in California. When normal time hits it\'s dark at 4:50.',
			'This is the only correct answer. Getting rid of it will ruin the long summer nights, and make spring and Autumn so brutal, when winter is already so long, dark, and rainy.',
			'Way easier to get up w/ a nice "light bulb sunrise" than it is to go out for a walk with a flashlight after work.',
			'Should get rid of timezones too. Use UTC all around the world.',
			'One "Earth Time" would be better. That would be incredible, actually. But, it\'s unlikely, as people suck at change.',
			'Yeah, but noon and midnight are also defined as "highest point and lowest point of the sun compared to the current destination" which would then get all kinds of fucked up. "Earth time" in that regards exists already as GMT being the base timezone used if you don\'t want to be specific about a location.',
			'Oh, I agree. GMT could be "Earth Time". I was just using a more sensationalistic phrase toward a romanticized notion of a unified scale of time for all of humanity. As far as noon and midnight definitions: they could still be the same, but be independent of the actual numbers. Along with sunrise and sunset, they could be the 4 numbers used in a given area (e.g. cities/towns) to help define where in the time system they fall. Many towns and cities already have such information available for sunrise and sunset; it wouldn\'t be a stretch for them to define their noon and midnight. Instead of adjusting your watch to the local time zone, you would just look up those 4 numbers quick, and you\'re done.',
			'Actually UTC and GMT are same things. Coordinated Universal Time Greenwich Mean Time',
			'Sorry, I wasn\'t trying to imply they are different. Those labels would also be quite functional. UTC is the most reasonable if extraterrestrial timekeeping was being taken into consideration. "Earth Time" is just sensationalism on my part.',
			'For most practical purposes, this is true, but they actually slightly differ. Leap seconds apply to UTC but not GMT.',
			'this creates a whole other issue where if I am working in say US at earth time (GMT) 2am, I have to think what time aus is working if im calling someone there. and if i travel internationally often it would just be as confusing as timezones (which people are already used to) so scrap DST (i think most places with dst are at 1hour difference?) since it doesnt affect much, but if u scrap timezones it just doesnt work',
			'The benefits of this are in larger scale global and extraterrestrial time coordination. A change will be needed eventually if our species continues to spread. Doing conversions all the time will become as messy as everyone having different units for length a few hundred years ago. While the suggestion I had is also imperfect, it removes the need to convert time at all. 14:00 in Sydney is 14:00 in Greenwich is 14:00 in Los Angeles. When coordinating, everyone just gives what time ranges work for them, and a time when all of them are available (e.g. awake and at work) can be easily selected; no conversions necessary. Just like 3 people living in the same town, but with very different schedules. As someone working nights, I can tell you this is quite easy to work with. "My" 07:00 is about 18:00 local time. I would hate to have to convert my "zone" of time to the local one for planning. All parties just understand that 18:00 is evening physically, most people are home or getting home from work, and I\'m leaving for work. And I\'m getting ready for bed around 11:00 local. It\'s pretty easy to get used to. Waaaaay easier than time zones. It\'ll just be shitty during the conversion. Which will be true regardless of how we redefine time measurement for daily use down the road. I\'m also a sailor, and, in general, fuck time zones.',
			'How about we start implementing the metric system globally for starters?',
			'If only. If only.',
			'Sorry, my country is too rock stupid for that. ',
			'If we are doing things right, we probably want to shift to base 12 :P',
			'Would it really be easier if, say, Thailand adopted GMT?  Right now if I want to speak to someone in Thailand, I convert the time and go, "okay, I can talk to them at 9:30 am GMT because they\'ll still be in the office."  If they used GMT though, then I\'d have to somehow figure out what point in the day they\'d be in the office. So I\'d still need to look at a conversion chart to know when they\'re likely to be awake.  Which might even be harder to do because there\'s no simple Thai time to convert it into. You\'d need to see a chart of when midday was in, say, Bangkok in GMT and then surely midday would be different within even fairly small geographical areas.  And the natural solution would be to invent time zones. ',
			'ockquote> And the natural solution would be to invent time zones.  Exactly. Timezones suck (especially as a programmer) but they\'re absolutely a solution to a problem. It drives me up the wall when people suggest only going by GMT everywhere would somehow be better, because it makes no sense once you look at it for more than 30 seconds. Standardized time makes sense, noon is noon everywhere, you have an immediate frame of reference when you travel, and you have an immediate frame of reference when you are figuring out the effective time of day for someone halfway across the globe.',
			'In regards to business, they\'re awake. I currently work 1900-0700. I communicate with India on a regular basis. The day shift talks to them at the beginning and end of the shift. It works fine. We don\'t even consider their time, and they ours. But, for tracking events in a global system (which is what we work with, power grids and generation), single time would be amazing. The computers are only as good at converting as the programmers who made them, and there are occasionally issues. There are also frequent issues with documentation from site personnel because of time zones. I personally cover most of North America. I talk to personnel and customers at locations across the country. They all use their own time. With no notation. I have to look up or memorize every single fucking location. Time errors are a definite thing, and have to be fixed. It is a huge waste of time. I\'m also a sailor, and can tell you that a single global time system would be far better for navigation and coordinating with people on land while you are continuously transiting time zones. It\'s horrible, right now. Imagine: I\'m leaving New York, USA at 14:00, it will take (hypothetically) 40 days and 12 hours to get to, let\'s say, Lisbon, Portugal. That means it will be 40 days, plus 12 hours, so you know that you will arrive at 02:00. You can check a quick chart for the sunrise/sunset times (similar to time zones), and you know that roughly what the daylight will be like. Way easier. People in different cultures tend to start and end work at different times, and those times don\'t always sync up with "business" hours in other countries. "Working hours" also becomes a moot point once you go to a 24 hour workplace, which is found in almost every major industry, now, to some degree or another. I do agree, though, that time zones could still play a role. Another comment thread made me realize it. But, I think it would be more productive to primarily use a global timescale, and use a local time zone for casual purposes. This could also be used as an intermediary, and I don\'t just mean for a few years, but longer term. Perhaps it could be implemented, and time zones abolished completely once a large enough portion of humanity is spacefaring. Or something like that.',
			'I live at 15E, so its nice to know when the sun is directly north and south. ',
			'That\'s a really bad idea. It doesn\'t remove the problem, as people would have to remember working hours of different countries/regions instead of just subtracting/adding numbers. It also makes it a lot more confusing as we have to consider that 02:00 would be noon for an example in some countries. Stop romanticising change so much, some things currently have no better replacements and should stay the way they are.',
			'People already can\'t remember time zones, so it doesn\'t matter what they remember. It matters if the reference is more complicated. It would be about the same. Systems would benefit greatly, though.',
			'Time zones are really easy for people and computers just work with UTC anyway. You only need to convert to local times for display. What\'s the issue?',
			'I find it fascinating that people think systems are more important to people. Rather than just make the systems better, tell people that 06:00 is now what used to be midnight in their region.  Seriously? And that makes some kind of sense to you? I mean... you wanna have to explain that to your grandparents? I don’t think you’ve thought the human end of the adoption through at all, at least as far as it impacts people without very similar lifestyles to your own. ',
			'The Swatch Internet Time* was pretty much this. And yes, it failed because people sucked at change :[  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time ',
			'UTC covers that perfectly without introducing a new time system. ',
			'No it failed because base 10 isn\'t good for modeling the rotation of the earth.',
			'Or common fractions. Or degree measurement systems of any type. Or... Base 10 is only convenient because we\'re comfortable with it. Mostly because of how many fingers we have. Really, any radix will work for math. Some are just easier for certain numbers for humans.',
			'The Babylonians chose 60 as their number base because it is divisible by the first three prime numbers: 2,3,5. Base 10 sucks anytime you have 3 of something.',
			'Sexagesimal is an awesome system for factoring, which makes it excellent for daily use. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. Very convenient. Easy math for fractions.',
			'exactly',
			'The ten fingers thing really isn\'t very important when you realize you have 12 phalanges on your fingers and can count them with your thumb.',
			'Which some cultures do use for counting.',
			'This is the stupidest fucking idea I\'ve ever heard.',
			'...really, I was just being nice in my comment, but yeah. Everything but the unifying time zones and DST part. Why would you re-design the whole fucking number system? Especially to decimal.',
			'Except ditching sexagesimal. A sexagesimal number system lends itself to more useful day-to-day calculations, and thus is a better number system for the average person. And the whole intent to commercially utilize amateur radio bands. That probably didn\'t sit too well with most governments. Or radio operators, which would have been the intended audience for that particular message.',
			'And good luck getting rid of the second, which is an S.I. unit.',
			'Literally the stupidest idea I\'ve heard touted on reddit as some sort of futuristic concept. Let\'s compare. Current time system:  Have to calculate time between time zones. You know that 12 PM = Noon and so on.  One time zone:  Have to calculate what time of day (ex. will it be sunlight or if they be asleep in India if you call from the US at 12 noon) You now have no concept of if 12 PM = noon or midnight or evening or morning or ???  Wow. What a great way to complicate the very nature of time. A thing that has been working fine for the last few, I don\'t know, CENTURIES of human history, to make a system that is convoluted, awkward, unneeded, and unwanted by literally almost everyone.',
			'I strive to only think about time as an Epoch value.',

			'Do you mean astronomical time?',
			'That won\'t really get rid of the confusion... You\'ll still be looking up what a daytime is in the destination. For example it can be 9:00 - 17:00 for you. But for someone else it can be 17:00 - 01:00 (and now you have to even deal with changing date midday). However I am all up for getting rid of a daylight saving time.',
			'You can\'t circumvent this... the world is big. The point is to get ird of the confusion of different time systems. You can\'t just say it is 1500 everywhere, that is bullshit.',
			'But you can simply use UTC +1 X hours. Elegant solution. Now there are Pacific, mid-desertern, western time and who else knows what.',
			'Oh yeah, I agree. Using UTC +-/X hours would be much better than having DST, BST, CEST and a lot of other names that hardly anyone can remember what times they actually represent.',
			'China has one time code for the entire nation. Technically, there are 5, but everything is done on Beijing time. When you interact with people in China, you still have to think about when is appropriate to contact them.',
			'Sure, when you\'re setting up a meeting with people in other longitudes you would need to deal with the fact that people will be awake at different times. But that\'s already the case; that problem wouldn\'t be getting worse. The advantage is that there would never be any ambiguity about what time you were discussing.',
			'I dont wanna be in patch duty if this ever happens',
			'Nah, people just need better habits when dealing with date&time in international settings. You watch a trailer with a release date 5.2.18 and you always have to guess whether it\'s an american bullshit date or not, which is impossible without any other identifier. You look at a event schedule to figure out when something starts and it\'s 9 AM - something (which is already more confusing than 24h time, for most people). And then they either don\'t list a timezone at all, because they\'re inconsiderate dicks, or you have to read the fineprint somewhere on the page. *All times PST Most people don\'t know what those time zones mean without googling them and then you have to guess is it PST or PDT and have they wrote the wrong thing. Why don\'t they always write 9:00 PST UTC-8, at least then you only need to know your own timezone offset to figure out when that is. We already have all the tools we need to coordinate international time&dates (to the point that automatic conversion would be trivial), it\'s just that there are a lot of inconsiderate assholes, that don\'t bother to adhere to those formats.',
			'lul but then 10am will be dark on the other side of the earth',
			'China uses this, only one timezone.',
			'And yet most people in the West use what their local time should be most of the time. Nobody is going to change if they\'re forced on UTC',
			'And it should be European time! 🇪🇺',
			'I\'ve actually never thought about that but it\'s a really good suggestion',
			'Personally I see this as a bad idea. As it is now, anyone from around the world can say "It\'s 10 AM here" and everyone else would know that it\'s mid-morning. Set up a universal time and people would know what time it is everywhere but wouldn\'t have context for what part of the day it is.',
			'I want to keep Daylight Saving Time. It moves a largely useless hour of daylight from 4am to 8pm here in the UK and that means people can enjoy a longer summer evening. Perhaps people living somewhere with consistently good summer weather don\'t realise it but in the UK you want to make as much use of good weather as you can.',
			'we should just move to +1 all year, problem solved.',
			'An issue with +1 all year is that, in winter, kids would be walking to school an hour before sunrise. The current system means UK school hours and daylight roughly match up in the winter and everyone get an extra hour of evening in the summer. Pretty good, I think.',
			'True, specially now that illumination is far cheaper than heating, DST has become an absurd way to waste energy. ',
			'but then I\'ll never see sun before work',
			'I don\'t see the sun either before or after work for all of December. Keeping DST year round would at least give me a bit for the commute home.',
			'You\'ll have a hard time seeing it before 9 at any time during the winter either way to be honest. Once the days start getting longer again sure but before that its mostly a somewhat lighter sky as opposed to actual sun',
			'Where do you live?',
			'Reading the article it seems they cannot abolish daylight savings time independent of of the EU. But they do appear to be able to change the timezone they adhere to independently of the EU. So... maybe they could keep daylight savings time but change timezones twice a year at the same moment?',
			'changing timezones of entire country would be just as bad. it might be okay from everyday joe\'s point of view, but from software and web point of view, the entire world would need to adapt to this change and some system will always not do that and then you\'re starting to run into more issues. you need to either abolish it globally or you\'re better off keeping things as they are. The more you look into timezones the more you realise how messed up they are just for the sake of 6am around the world being when the sun rises, for a few days a year because earth\'s movement isn\'t as stable as people would want it to be.',
			'Fuck man time zones can’t keep up with us in northern Canada. Sunsets occur anywhere from 4:30 pm to 11 pm depending if it’s winter or summer. ',
			'Can we do that in the states too? IIRC studies have shown that there\'s a massive increase in accidents around each of the switches. Also, in general, messing with people\'s sleep schedules/cycles is NOT a good thing.',

			'I\'m a shift worker. When on night shift, I flip my schedule back every time I get some days off so I\'m not spending my time off watching infomercials at 3AM while my family sleeps. I did shift work in the Navy, plus I did 18 hour rotations when underway on submarines. Daylight Savings Time doesn\'t even register with me. What really confused me is people who sleep in for hours on the weekends and then complain about a one hour change twice a year.',
			'Also heart attacks ',
			'It’s in elderly people, and I if waking up an hour later or earlier will cause this, most likely it would have happened within days anyway. ',
			'We can\'t even adopt the metric system man we aren\'t doing anything we aren\'t absolutely forced to do...',
			'I think we should permanently stay on day light savings because of the extra day light we get during summer. ',
			'Same. It would just seem so wrong for the sun to set at 7:30 in the middle of summer where I am.',
			'Yes, we can. I’ve been an activist for years on this issue in California. The bill gets introduced yearly and is slowly making checkpoint progress. I’m hoping this will be done by 2019.',
			'It looks like Jonah Ryan is spreading his doctrine across the world now. ',
			'ockquote> The Finnish government wants to abolish the use of daylight saving time. (...) At the same time the country is considering switching timezones as well. One option would be to switch to the western European time, which is two hours later (...)  This would mean they\'d have more daylight in the mornings that they\'re likely to spend in the office anyway. Living in mid-Norway, I like daylight savings time because it provides some light in the afternoon when I get off work. I usually find turning back to normal, UTC+1, time detrimental to my psyche, because I am bereft of daylight both in the morning and in the afternoon over night. Better stay on daylight saving hours (UTC+2) and scrap "normal" hours.',
			'Exactly. I want daylight when I get off work, not when I\'m stuck in an office. ',
			'It would really make more sense to switch to daylight saving time in the winter and standard time in the summer, when the days are long enough as it is.',
			'Or y\'know.. come to work an hour later in the winter. ',
			'Not everyone can make their own schedule at work. ',
			'I didn\'t mean individual schedules. But if it makes sense for the majority, the number on the clock is just an arbitrary number. I know there are a lot of places where those kind of changes will drown in bureaucracy, but it is not an unsolvable problem. ',
			'That’s kind of the whole point of daylight saving though. Move the time a bit so we get more sunlight in the time we are operational. I get that it doesn’t matter a lot other places, but in Norway it’s a pretty big deal because we get so little daylight and one in ten get winter depression. Hard to regulate a law forcing all workplaces to change operational times during the winter unfortunately.',
			'I\'m from Denmark. Not exactly long days I the winter here either. But I am also a software developer, and I utterly hate dealing with DST issues every year :) Seriously, I know it will take some change, but I also think it is worth it to do so. ',

			'Yea, fuck mornings! Let\'s boycott those too while we\'re at it. Only psychopaths and farmers like mornings anyways.',
			'Well most people start work or school at 8 or 9 anyways. In that case it doesnt really matter if the sun is up at 9 or 10 since its still pitch dark when they have to get up either way. And after that they are mostly stuck in a building until the evening. ',
			'Well, even with winter time here, it\'s still dark when you go to work and dark when you leave work. You only see daylight during weekends. Also no sun until some days in February. Sunshine during november to january is very rare. ',
			'Daylight time really should be considered the standard time in the US considering it\'s 8 months out of the year. As a result of that, the primary reasons for clocks changing isn\'t so the sun will set an hour later in the summer, it\'s so the sun will come up an hour earlier in the winter.',

			'Yes pleeeeeeease ! I\'m fed up of changing time and re-adaptating my sleep everytime we change daylight time !',
			'Maybe this is an unpopular opinion, but I really don\'t get what the big fuss about daylight savings time is. Maybe it\'s just me, but my sleeping routine doesn\'t really get fucked up by that one hour. Is this something similar to people allegedly getting diarrhea from Taco Bell?',

			'Thanks for asking! It took her a couple of days to adjust, as though she was jet-lagged. Yeah, the potential for it being in her head was indeed real, but it didn\'t make a difference in how she felt.',
			'If you\'ve ever had to conduct work across a variety of different countries, with different timezones, some using DST, others not, and not all DST changes occurring on the same date (I\'m looking at you North America!) then you\'d support this. It\'s hard enough to schedule conference calls and work with colleagues half way around the planet without this nightmare making it worse.',
			'In this day and age how is this difficult?',
			'Because project managers can never seem to work it out, and then blame the engineers when they get the times wrong',
			'But it\'s not like they\'re remembering every single time zone, they\'re looking it up through Google or something to get the particular time zone which will say if it\'s dst. You\'re working internationally, if your project manager can\'t comprehend daylight saving time why are they managing the project.',
			'One aspect is the effect on ERPs and other heavy IT solutions. DST changes are rather expensive for some companies.',
			'Which ERP can\'t handle clock changes? ',
			'ockquote> Maybe it\'s just me, but my sleeping routine doesn\'t really get fucked up by that one hour.  It\'s you. There\'s piles of research about the detrimental effects of changing the clocks by an hour twice a year, and anecdotally, my wife and I both take at least a week to adjust.',
			'Yeah I mean I do worse weekly. Always going to bed around 23h, up at 7h during the weekday. But then Friday comes, party stuff and I go to bed at 3-4am, wake up Saturday past noon, and get back to my usual schedule for Monday morning. I find it a bit overkill for people to complain about ONE hour change twice per year.',
			'Unlike you most people have regular jobs instead of sitting at home all day',
			'Honestly, from my experience of being in Finland during October, December (and soon to be March), daylight saving time had little effect because the majority of the time it was dark. It was only beginning to get bright around 8am, getting dark at 3-4pm.  Just don\'t feel it matters much over there.',
			'If anybody has a say, it should be the far north countries. They are most impacted by the lack of sunlight in the winter months.',
			'Without DST we would essentially lose an hour of usable sunlight in the summer, that is unless you like getting up at 5am. If anything DST should be maintained all year. ',
			'This is my beef with the whole debate. We should set clocks so that we might have some darkness in the morning, but make sure we have usable daylight in the evening. ',
			'Depends on where you live, doesn\'t it?',
			'I’m all fir that! People keep posting “it’s dark all the time anyways” which is bullshit. The daylight savings now makes it daylight early in the day as opposed to the afternoon. I can see it if you’re out and about farming but most of us go to regular office jobs. So now I get to go to work with a slight sunrise and go to pick up my kids in the pitch black. I would much rather go to work in the dark and go home with some light left in the day. ',
			'The one where it\'s daylight later in the evening is daylight savings. That\'s the one that would go away. What you want is permanent daylight savings, which would be my preference as well.',
			'I can’t believe this garbage is upvoted. What you want is permanent day light savings time',
			'Why the hostility? To most people who don\'t know the exact definition of daylight savings time, the idea of abolishing DST means just not changing the time twice a year. It doesn\'t matter what the new standard time is called, if you don\'t change the clocks, you don\'t have Daylight Savings time.',
			'The fuck are you talking about? Daylight savings sets the clock forwards, not backwards. That is, at 7pm, it\'s actually 6pm, and therefore lighter. What you want is permanent day light savings. ',
			'Ok whatever the fuck it called, my text clealy states I want it to be light during the afternoon as opposed to the morning. All year round. And if that called nightlife savings, morning savings or whatver, just abolish the early light!',
			'Or would be just moving to another timezone?',
			'It\'s not for farmers. Farmers can get up and go to bed when they want. It\'s for office workers. Daylight savings doesn\'t make it light earlier, it makes it light until later.

The only way that system makes sense is if you never leave your small geographic area.

But yes, a lot of people would have to re-learn the what times "feel natural" and people in general are quite conservative when it comes to these things.

			'We\'re not using daylight saving during the winter so obviously abolishing it would change nothing... Unless you want to go to a permanent summer time in which case it would be like going to work at 7 and coming home at 3:30 which might give you some sun after work. ',

It\'s already the case since DST is during the other half of the year (summer), also it\'s only 1 hour and wouldn\'t change a thing for people working 9AM-5PM even if it was in winter.',
			'ockquote> Why change get rid of it in the 21st century?  DST has a lot of downsides -- for everyday people, simply the inconvenience of having the clocks change and having to adjust your internal clock, particularly when you lose an hour, and the general downsides of disrupting your sleep cycle (for example, trafic accidents increase following the shift, as do workplace injuries). Various studies have found businesses experience decreased productivity in the days following the clocks-forward change, and since not everyone observes DST, doing business across time-zones can have complications during this shift. The major trade-off was supposed to be that it saves energy as a result of not having to turn the lights on as much, however this has repeatedly been debunked. The most famous study was probably the one that happened in 2006, when several counties in Indiana, which had not previously observed DST, began to do so. Rather than saving energy, those counties actually saw a 1-4% increase in energy usage. So there are real downsides to DST, without any upsides outside of people who simply prefer having more darkness in the morning than the evening.',

Unfortunatelly, the most prominent police union leader is the guy who heads the second largest union, an idiotic crook who constantly pushes for harder punishments of pretty much everything (with the exception of getting paid for doing policework while not working at all for over a decade because you are busy being a police union leader, and lying about it, which is what he did).

			'Well I would call racial motivation suitable ideological cause to furthering for this was done. Thus making it ideologically motivated violence, terrorism. Ofcourse the rub is, there is differences in what different people and legislations count as terrorism. Somedefinitions include only political motivation. Some wider ideological motivation. Some definitions require acting as part of group, for some mere adherence to ideology is enough. Some require spefic target or for example attacking government. Some defitions require certain indiscriminate nature and causing panic and terror. Some require clear intent to affect specific political change. Etc. Terrorism is one of those tricky legal cases of intent. For example here in Finland a terrorism case just failed to convict on preparing terroristic acts, because court said prosecutor could not show clear evidence of terroristic intent. So  a) the situation is still fluid in Italy, investigation is on going and legal proceedings will be a long process. b) prosecutor might be hesitant to drive for terrorist charges, if they think failure of proving clear enough terroristic intent (in legal meaning) and terroristic nature of the crime might lead to case collapsing.  c) which means they might be driving the case on the more common variety charge of intent to murder to ensure conviction d) what legally happens and what happens in public discourse is two different things.

			'Ex-pharmacist here: when I was training in the mid-80s, each NHS district would typically have a pharmaceutical manufacturing suite in its largest hospital pharmacy unit, dedicated to producing small batches or one-off bespoke products like this. Typically stuff that couldn\'t be purchased because it wasn\'t economically viable as a business model for any pharmaceutical company.  For example: ambulatory peritoneal dialysis fluid is basically a sterile isotonic solution, and each patient needs several litres of it a day. The cost of the ingredients is pennies per litre, but it needs to be prepared in an aseptic suite and then autoclaved to ensure it\'s sterile, and then subjected to standard pharmaceutical quality control. So the cost is roughly 99.9% overheads (plant, people, and QA/monitoring) and the product is bulky/heavy to ship around, and there was sod-all profit in it. So the district pharmaceutical service had a small factory, a couple of supervisory pharmacists and lab technicians, and ran a manufacturing operation that probably cost half a million to a couple of million quid per year and kept a district with on the order of half a million people supplied with dialysis fluid (and a bunch of other stuff Glaxo and ICI and Bayer couldn\'t see a profit in manufacturing). I quit the profession in 1990. Some time betwixt then and now, guess what got shut down/downsized in the name of cost-cutting and free market dogma? With results like this. (If a prescription for a custom moisturizer came down — something in the BP or BPC that was well out of patent and not available off-the-shelf — some muggins would get to make it from scratch. Probably 1-2 hours\' work, plus QA and so on. So about 50p for ingredients and £25-50 for labour. But the facility was in-house, so it\'d be billed internally for something like £25.50 to £50.50, without the price-gouging we see here.)',

			'And they can do, but it\'s also he right of a government to decide a maximum price on a product and then the company can decide if they still want to sell it in that territory, if the price of manufacture is low then no doubt they\'ll carry on selling it even if the price is a lot lower, benefiting actual people.',
			'Why doesn\'t the government just buy the drug from someone else? The article says "BCM sold the NHS one 500ml tub of a cream made up specifically for patients with skin problems for £1,579. It could be bought elsewhere for £1.73." So buy it elsewhere',

That\'s their decision.',
			'Thats where most people in the UK will disagree with you, especially in respect to \'anything that doesn\'t infringe upon the rights of others\' - the government\'s job doesn\'t stop at the police dept. The market does not always make rational, fair or reasonable decisions, which is not something we want to encourage or allow. You can set the price, as long as it is within reason. I can\'t see any possible argument as to how allowing this sort of thing is beneficial to society, any exchange that takes place at this price is entirely one-sided. The pot of moisturiser is definitively not worth anything like the price they\'re asking, and charging it cannot be much more than a scam. So again, why should society support it?',
			'See, my criticisms function a priori to the assumed right of that entity (the government in the form you champion) to exist. I can understand how you can morally justify forcing others to assimilate to morals that protect other\'s autonomy (such as outlawing murder, theft, rape etc.);those are even necessary for a society to function. But to abuse the power of your government to force people to give you free shit is sickening. You are forcing altruism (as you have constructed) and mandating conformity in arbitrary and unfair forms. Government shouldn\'t be god. If 60% of my country hates red, says I can\'t wear red, and will arrest me if I do so, would that be just?  And it\'s not society\'s support that matters; you are making a lot of assumptions about things such as whether anyone would pay that or thinks it\'s worth that. That is for individuals to determine. Maybe it\'s worth $39 to me and $2000 to someone else. We are in the best place to determine what\'s worth what for ourselves.',
			'If they don\'t like it they can do business elsewhere. Stopping people get ripped off on something as important as healthcare is not even close to immoral, no matter how you try to spin it. "Wearing red" is nothing like "needing medicine for health purposes"',

This isn\'t a mild markup, this is a stupid amount of money for an objectively near worthless product. Red is a preference, the law does not extend to such ridiculous extremes, you\'re taking words out of my mouth. Nobody is harmed by you wearing the colour red, but the harm involved in abusing your position to massively overcharge the taxpayer is obvious. Government isn\'t god? Not sure how that\'s relevant to this. The government is seeing that abuse of a position is taking place, that corporations are not asking for a reasonable amount for a fair exchange of goods and that taxpayers are suffering as a result. Their job is to regulate the market, which is exactly what they\'re threatening to do in response to unfair exchanges taking place. Don\'t start a business to produce and sell the product in this regulated market if it has additional value to you and you will not sell anywhere near it\'s objective value? The cost to produce is objective fact, nobody is making you sell your cream, but just like the law requires the price to be clearly displayed with all costs included, it can also require you to charge a reasonable amount for it. If something more expensive has to be done to produce the cream, obviously that is a factor in how much you can charge. No part of it justifies the insane cost in this situation. ',

For those who want a better more "first class" experience they have the option to go private, you\'ll get your own room and better more personal service in general & better food, but it costs and back in the day private was a luxury option people didn\'t really opt for it unless work had medical cover or they were well off... but that\'s all the difference was, infact if your op goes wrong under private care it is the NHS staff/resources that save your life (for free) while the private staff stand back. But, in recent years it\'s becoming more and more common to go private as the NHS has long waiting lists and limited bed space even for important heart surgerys etc you can be told it\'s months away & may face cancellations right upto while your ass hanging out of the medical gown or go private for £7000 and your heart op will be done tomorrow.....ironically often by the same surgeon in the same hospital. This is all largely due to Tory government fudging numbers & putting a rich toff who loves the American health care system in control of the NHS.

So it went NHS Pays for private then private pays to use NHS resources, they help each other out.  Even private couldn\'t fix me up and a few years later they decided to try plastic surgery to help close my wound and it was under the NHS which ended up working. ',

			'thats not why this is a problem. they are jacking up the prices specifically because the sales are secure and they dont have to compete. they are outside the restrictions of capitalism and the free market, and exploiting it. even worse, this price gouging would almost certainly come after they established this sales channel and the customers back was turned its more like, you could go to a shop and buy ice cream for a few dollars depending what flavour you choose, but your company has a contract with an ice cream shop and gives you a voucher for free ice cream, that they will pay for. they tell you to get at much as you want of any flavour, because a few dollars per ice cream is worth a happy employee. you stop paying attention to the price of ice cream flavours, and the company pays whatever the bill is each month. one month they get charged $2000 per ice cream because the shop suddenly decided that a scoop of vanilla was worth that much, while no other shop in the area charges over a dollar for it. also every shop in the area has the same supplier, so product and cost prices are identical the next month you lose your job because your company paid $200,000 for your ice cream. also you have developed diabetes and dont have health insurance because a similar thing happened with the price of moisturisers',
			'I think you missed my point, I agree with you, the NHS should be able to buy from anyone they want :) But that comment was specifically making fun of the person quoted in the article for getting the solution wrong.',
			'You may have missed mine. I wasn\'t saying that the solution to price hikes is to avoid being locked in, but that being locked in is a scummy reason to hike prices.  I think the difference is whether you place blame on the company for ripping off the customer, or the customer for letting themselves be ripped off. I say fuck the company, they are the ones being shitty and acting in bad faith. Their behaviour should be stamped down because it holds back everyone else. '

			'Tl:Dr - If he is to be prosecuted for his crimes, he will be prosecuted in the UK, not in the US, because mental health issues(his supporters allege he would commit suicide, that the US doesn\'t do enough to prevent something like that).   The judges also urged the Crown Prosecution Service to work with US authorities because of "the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims". The judges added that "if proven, these are serious offences indeed" in regards to what he is being accused of.  So he doesn\'t appear to be innocent. ',
			'good , he wouldn\'t have gotten a fair trial in U.S. ',
			'What, specifically, do you think wouldn\'t have been fair?',
			'I\'d argue that the pressure used to get people to accept plea deals, including stacking charges creates significant problems, not to mention issues with speedy access to justice and pre-trial detention (especially if the person in question has challenged extradition) as well as the conditions under which you could be held. You also have issues with the offence in this case having essentially been committed in the UK, by someone from the UK and so realistically UK law should probably apply. The penalties and indeed legislation governing the acts in question are somewhat different so it\'d be problematic to extradite someone and apply very different rules. All in though, the US justice system is more of a mess than the UK one and that does cause problems in the context of extradition generally, doubly so when it isn\'t someone fleeing the US to the UK.',
			'It\'s not a secret that US prosecutors tends to use dirty tactics, when it comes to winning a conviction. Add to that, judges there are elected, and you got a recipe for disaster.',
			'I think you are confused. Federal Judges are appointed and not elected. The Judges are usually very thorough so as to avoid an appeal. So unless you hire a very stupid lawyer (it happens) -- it\'s very unlikely the prosecutor will try a dirty tactic or succeed. If they attempt and it\'s shown -- the Judge will stomp on their dick pretty hard. The Judges don\'t like being lied to or mislead. Remember -- this isn\'t some Dukes of Hazzard kind of thing where it\'s county level with a backwoods Sheriff and Judge who are elected by a small few people and everyone knows everyone. This would be on the Federal level. Prosecutors are known, however, for coming at you with a lot. Meaning every little law you broke they will come at you. Think: Al Capone. They may not get you on hacking but they\'ll get you on something else (e.g. unauthorized access or violation of the telecoms act of 1996). If you\'re thinking of the Aaron Schwartz stuff -- that stuff was more complicated than CNN/FOX told you and when you read the details then the decisions everyone made makes a lot more sense.',

			'Got to correct you on a few things here Today was not about sending this man to prison, it was about where his trial should take place. He is not yet a guilty man. This man already has depression, which was a factor for the judge to consider regarding his own health and his likelihood of suicide. This is in combination with the fact he has Asperger\'s syndrome. He committed his crime on UK soil - hacking US institutions does not grant the US the right to extradition.',
			'ockquote> He committed his crime on UK soil - hacking US institutions does not grant the US the right to extradition.  Going to have to disagree here. The discussion wasn\'t about whether or not the US has the right -- it was about his condition and whether or not the US could extradite based on that. If he didn\'t have those conditions he would have been sent to the US.',
			'Not necessarily, if he didn\'t have these conditions, we don\'t know what other arguments the defense would make to stop the extradition. We\'re assuming that this was his only defense, and his lawyer didn\'t have a back up plan.',

Minimum age limits on content is quite common and usual, and Facebook is definitely 16+ in my opinion, especially considering that even a "vetted" friend could turn out to be their dodgy dad or uncle or something.

		title: 'After riots over heavily discounted Nutella, France to ban "buy one get one" sales of food items ',
		ments: [
			'I\'m not a fan of Nutella myself... but I am finding it hard to think of anything I would riot over due to a sale. Usually it just means a trip to another store if they don\'t have it in stock.',
			'Italy is the craziest country I\'ve seen with Nutella... it\'s usually on display in places that offer it...it\'s really odd over there.  Tastes great and all but sugartella or Palmoiltella would be a more accurate name than Nutella for the product. ',
			'am I the only human who find Nutella disgusting?',
			'Apparently the recipe/quality/taste differs massively depending on what country you are buying it in. ',
			'No, no you’re not. Can’t stand it myself. It looks delicious though. ',
			'i find peanut butter disgusting. nutella is fine, although i would not be able to eat too much at once, too sweet.',
			'yeah, I like it. but a little goes a LONG way.',
			'A lot goes even further though. Sometimes I put bread on my nutella.',
			'the flavor is just really strong and too rich for me to want a lot of. I like it in moderation, or in other desserts.',
			'American peanut butter or European? Since there is a big difference between the two.',
			'It\'s a far cry from "disgusting" unless you\'re a picky eater. It\'s just some weird sorta-tasty-i-guess junky sweet. It\'s like icing. Or Twinkies. Or eating raw cookie dough. It\'s sweet crap. It\'s fine. Everybody relax. ',
			'It\'s actually kind of bitter and acrid tasting to me. Those are two things i really don\'t like having overlayed onto a wall of sugar and oil. I don\'t even know what in it does it cause i love hazelnuts, and cocoa is in 3/4 of my favorite treats.',
			'I think there is something about Nutella recipe not being the same depending of country. Maybe you would like the french Nutella.',
			'ockquote> kind of bitter and acrid tasting to me  K Downvotes to the left my doodz, what do you say to someone that eats an absurdly sugary product and says it\'s "bitter and acrid"?  Lol it\'s basically fucking frosting. ',
			'That he\'s someone for whom the artificial flavors don\'t sit properly? It\'s mostly chemical flavorings, and some people react weirdly to them in some combinations.',
			'Everything you eat is basically a "chemical flavoring" because everything\'s a chemical.',
			'They mean "something which is meant to imitate the flavor of something else". Like how aspartame tastes weird even though it\'s meant to imitate sugar',
			'This person could be hypersensitive to the hazelnut flavor, which I guess could be described as bitter. Either that or they are Satan. I’m sure it’s one of those.',
			'And I fucking hate frosting. It\'s the worst part of cake. ',
			'[deleted]',
			'Calm the fuck down. ',
			'Don\'t be retarded',
			'It\'s the same for me! I think because there\'s so much sugar plus the oil as a flavor carrier in there the sweetness gets too high and becomes way too much and sort of...flips? to being bitter and sour.',
			'It\'s pretty disgusting.',
			'It\'s better than peanut butter, at least. ducks away',
			'It\'s especially useful as fake poop. ',
			'How are you trying to eat it? There are a lot of ways and some people can just eat it with a spoon (gross), while others treat it much more like a chocolate paste and would put a fairly small amount in baking (delicious).',
			'I don\'t even like chocolate. ',
			'I don’t mind, well I didn’t as a kid. But it was something I would eat rarely at my cousins house. I don’t like consuming it though, because of how destructive it is. I should cut out more things though ',
			'ockquote> sugartella or Palmoiltella would be a more accurate name than Nutella for the product.  Pretty much, yeah.',
			'Isn\'t palm oil red in colour. Why does it look cream-coloured in that picture?',
			'It\'s refined palm oil. Only the unrefined kind is red.',
			'ockquote> Tastes great and all but sugartella or Palmoiltella  And now you know why it\'s popular in Italy. I swear to god, I haven\'t seen a country with a worse diet. Sugar and Palm is breakfast...I mean standard BREAKFAST.',
			'Chocolatella with a hint of hazelnut is what I get from it tbh. I\'m truly baffled that anyone would riot over something like that, under those conditions of society being fine and not post apocalyptic too. Then again I\'m American and we managed only one semi-riot over trump which puts things into perspective imho.',
			'In America you\'ve got more disposable income to splurge on food and sweets, so it\'s a bigger deal in France or Italy if there\'s a good opportunity to stock up on something.  Just imagine the riots there would be if an American hospital offered free or heavily discounted health care for a limited time. Then it would be the French shaking their heads at the scenes.',
			'Both of you guys responses make me wonder if either of you ever left your village.  Discounters are common in europe and much more fiercly competitive then their american counterpats. This is part of the reason why walmart can\'t get a foot on the ground in europe. That\'s why you are now seeing european chains like Aldi, Spar and Albert Hein competing with walmart in the us. Those european discounters smelled blood in the water.  This nutella thing is weird to everyone, that\'s why it\'s garnering such response.',
			'It is asinine to get violent over a snack. You\'re personal health is a much higher priority, one that we nonetheless do not take very seriously here.',
			'What a stupid and horrible comparison, intended to be deliberately insulting. Pat yourself on the back.',
			'Like the majority of other products out there.',
			'Don\'t underestimate desperate people. The sale was -75% of the original price. The next week it happened again over baby diapers.  Our system is walking on its head.',
			'Rioting over discounted food is a sure sign of a wealth gap that has gone too far and is about to collapse a society.',
			'the term riots is such an hyperbole to speak about 10 dude in a supermarket fighting over a nutella lol',
			'Yeah, but fighting over chocolate (and hazelnut) spread is pretty bonkers. ',
			'THERE WERE NO RIOTS god. It was a scuffle in a supermarket for gods sake',
			'Completely. But in France, you\'ll never see customers fight over a product in a store. Every year we laugh watching the scenes in the US during Black Friday. So as it happened here for once, every french media talked about it, and others followed. Actually nothing really happened. ',
			'How else are media websites going to get clicks?',
			'ockquote> The proposed legislation will effectively prohibit “buy one, get one free” offers by barring supermarkets from making discounts of more than 34 percent. But “buy two, get one free” discounts would still be allowed, Travert said.  Is it still a free market if simple marketing like "50% off" is banned by government?',
			'Does Kohls have stores in France? If so they\'re fucked. That\'s like their entire Business model.',
			'JC Penney is even more ridiculous. I\'ve never really shopped there but I stopped in last week. I\'m not exaggerating when I say about 90% of the items had signs for between 30%-50% off. It\'s almost worth walking in there to see it. I can\'t believe such an obvious scam actually works. (I assume it must or they wouldn\'t do it). I felt like my intelligence was insulted walking in there. I also found cooking tongs not on sale. They were priced at $17, no joke.',
			'It\'s what people want https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2013/09/27/a-strategic-mistake-that-haunts-j-c-penney/',
			'How much of that is intentional though. Stores know that people generally are more likely buy stuff if a sign says 30%-50%. If they inflate their markup to absorb that, the sale is more or less an illusion just to get you to buy stuff you wouldn\'t buy otherwise because it\'s on sale. ',
			'Apparently its illegal to just say "50% off!" without actually selling the product somewhere for the full price so there are literally unmarked secluded warehouses tucked away in rural nowhere that sell these things at the full price to facilitate this. ',
			'It\'s hard to believe companies do this, but I could see it they realize those products sell rarely and don\'t have to restock often, people who live their pay it because it\'s all that\'s around and they don\'t buy that often. ',
			'I mean, these obviously only exist in jurisdictions that made that a law so its just an example of the unintended consequences of regulations. I think its the right thing to do, companies shouldn\'t be just allowed to say "50% off an arbitrary price that doesn\'t actually exist!!!" But then forcing their hands essentially does nothing. ',
			'The clearance rack at Kohls is the sweet spot. I got 2 awesome shirts yesterday for $4 each.',

			'well.. I mean if you want a technical workaround you CAN buy and sell slaves its just illegal to hold people as property. It is sort of separate. Like, is it still a free market if you cant buy a hitman? I find it difficult to argue that laws preventing murder impinge on the free market. Of course someone could argue against that too but, I dunno ',

			'There are degrees to how free a "free market" is but price controls like no "Buy one get one" sound like old school communist policies.',
			'If large Corperations are allowed to use their buying power to drive prices down artificially, than they do so at a very small incremental profit, and only make money by moving LOADS of product. It\'s a nasty business, and France had the galls to put the breaks on questionable business practices. Good for them. Meanwhile in North America we subsidize our Corperations, offer them our first-born children, and pay them to dance on our graves.',
			'Calling promotions, something that all businesses that sell to consumers do, "nasty business" is just silly. Further, unnecessary price controls like banning promotional sales, is likely to have unintended consequences and is stupid. So it\'s not France having the gall to put the breaks on questionable business practices. It\'s France being stupid when it comes to markets... again.',
			'You realize that such a policy literally couldn\'t even exist under a communist regime right?',
			'I was thinking this was about fair trade and competition, and the corporate responsibility that is encouraged elsewhere, but Commies … that can\'t be good.',
			'Is any market truly a "free market" though. As soon as any regulation good/bad is put in place it\'s not a free market anymore ',
			'Even without regulation a market can be not free at all. In the US a lot of our industries, if not all, are manipulated by the corporations to confuse the consumer into making the market very much not free. Healthcare is a great example where consumers have no idea how much medicine costs and the big corporations purposely lobby our lawmakers to continue that status quo in everyway possible.',
			'Yeah in truth the "Healthcare" corporations are only concerned with collecting premium dollars. They don\'t concern themselves with the associated health care costs because they just pass it onto their members. Obamacare was a big day for the Healthcare companies.',

			'The goverment\'s task is to regulate labelling. You cannot have free market where I am allowed to sell heroin labelled as apples. IMO this should go much further as proper labelling restrictions such as ingredient listing only helps the market. What would be a more effective deterrent for energy overconsumption: Tarifs or forcing the label of total fossil fuel consumption on each product? Similarly: "two for the price of one" is technically a lie that should be forbidden. One we\'re so used, we just suck it up.',
			'ockquote> "two for the price of one" is technically a lie that should be forbidden.  It isn\'t though. Promotions are a thing that actually happen. Companies take a short term loss in the hopes that it will drive up long term demand after the promotion ends. Buy one get one free isn\'t some lie.',
			'If the price of two apples is $1 then in that deal, each apple costs $0.50.',
			'If I normally sell apples for $1, then for the next week I\'m gonna give you 2 apples for $1, then go right back to 1 apple = $1, there is absolutely nothing wrong with calling it a buy one get one free deal.',
			'So where does "normal" start? Can I say a $1 apple has 50% discount because I sold it for $1.50 one Monday two years ago? What is wrong with enforcing simply stating the price? An individual business may benefit from marketing, but society only benefits from marketing if it conveys information. In this case a simple price is clearly a better way to that than an ambiguous, relative to "normal" claim. Market mechanisms benefit from enforcing it in the same way we benefit from ingredient listing.',

			'Since few people are reading the article: This isn\'t really about nutella induced riots (who would\'ve thought), but an ongoing plan to combat price dumping in the food sector. They want to ensure farmers and the like can still earn a living, and to do that they have to combat discount grocery store practices such as selling items with almost no profit margin, which hurt the supply side, as they have to accept these unreasonably low prices or die. Also in France selling items at a loss is prohibited, but the article implies that this didn\'t apply to \'buy one get two\'-type of deals, which allowed the stores to circumvent this regulation.',
			'Can I say both that this is a great comment but one that misses the point? I think the point of this article is "France passes stupid rule". And your comment basically lays out why they are doing it but the why\'s all feed into the thesis that "this is a stupid rule". 1) Farmers need to earn a living. Farmers should sell their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then. If no one wants to buy their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then they should either make different crops or stop being farmers. Its economics 101. 2) Selling items at a loss is prohibited Another stupid rule. There are all sorts of situations where you would want to sell something at a loss. This is a bit like saying "Businesses are prohibited from failing". ',
			'ockquote> Farmers should sell their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then. If no one wants to buy their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then they should either make different crops or stop being farmers. Its economics 101.  This is ignorant of the fact that it is important for a country to have it\'s own supply of staple food grown within their own borders. That means crafting laws and policies to protect your own industry from being undercut and falling apart.  It\'s an important part of national security.',
			'This is a valid concern but a different problem. What is being discussed here is the problems caused by stores selling food for too low a price. What you are describing is a problem caused by importing food at too low a price (and the resulting national security and international relations issues). The first problem is properly dealt with by simply economics. The second problem is handled by trade agreements, import rules, etc. But in terms of regulating your domestic market this is a foolish way to do things and is actually counter-productive to your goal (i.e. if you want to make sure ALL of your food is imported, then prohibit selling at a loss and that way the absolute lowest cost option -the imported stuff- is suddenly a much more flexible product as it permits deeper discounting and more freedom of action).',
			'ockquote> This isn\'t really about nutella induced riots (who would\'ve thought), but an ongoing plan to combat price dumping in the food sector. They want to ensure farmers and the like can still earn a living, and to do that they have to combat discount grocery store practices such as selling items with almost no profit margin, which hurt the supply side, as they have to accept these unreasonably low prices or die.  Stores discount too much (forcing farmers to lower their prices or they purchase elsewhere) If farmers cannot afford to go lower you suggest:   Farmers should sell their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then. If no one wants to buy their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then they should either make different crops or stop being farmers. Its economics 101.  These issues are interlinked. Stop saying it\'s "simple economics" and "economics 101". These are incredibly complicated issues and your cursory glance at it with the most basic logic is totally useless. I\'m trying to help you understand that there are levels to this.',
			'"Hello, this is the Grocery Store. I\'d like 500 tons of apples." "Sure, its 500 a ton so that will be 250,000. I can get them to you for thursday." "Actually, we are only selling the apples for 50 cents a pound so can you lower your price to 400 a ton?" "No. You sell it for what you want to but your sale price doesn\'t impact what I am willing to sell you my apples for." "Fine, then we will buy our apples from someone else." "Sure, if you can. And I\'ll find another store to buy my apples at 500 a ton." That is literally how every industry operates. From printer paper, to pig iron, to apples, to computers, to iPhones. It isn\'t overly simplistic. And if the farmer can\'t find someone to pay 500 a ton for his apples he needs to figure out how to make apples for less money. And if he can\'t figure that out, but someone else can, that someone else gets more orders for apples, expands, takes over the farmer\'s orchard, and uses the land more efficiently. ',
			'And when you can import apples from mexico for 250 a ton, the stores will always go for the mexican apples. This forces your own farmers to completely give up on apples. Now take this and apply it to dozens of other crops or sources of food and you start to see a problem. We enforce higher minimum wages and working safety standards and that increases the minimum cost to pull these crops from the ground, that means our own farmers have to charge more money to make any kind of profit. If no shop will touch them because they can take them from a 3rd world country for half the price, you lose your farming industry. That is why the government intervenes and enforces laws that prevent companies from destroying local farming. I\'m done trying to convince you if you aren\'t going to take 5 minutes to actually think about why Farmer Jean Paul\'s apples may cost more money than Zao\'s apples from China, and why the government would step in to ensure their own industry can make money.',
			'But you don\'t solve that issue by prohibiting stores from selling at below cost. You solve that issue with trade tarrifs on mexican apples. I\'m all for having a domestic food supply and preventing foreign imports. But that has nothing to do with what price a store sells its stuff for. These are just completely different topics and this is a dumb law that is attempting to conflate them.',
			'A country within the EU cannot just decide to impose tariffs, it must be done by the whole body. This is one way in which they can impose restrictions to protect their own industries. If a store cannot sell at below cost they cannot force farmers down below where they are profitable.',
			'Lets say you were the grocery store. Mexican apples cost 250 a ton, french apples cost 500 a ton. I can\'t sell for a loss. My competitors are selling applies for 501 a ton. I could buy french apples and make 1 a ton, or I can buy mexican apples and make 251 a ton. France\'s stupid law just made mexican apples 250 times more profitable than french apples. ',
			'Well, I disagree with it being a stupid rule. Saying "if no one wants to buy their crops for a price that permits them to have a living then they should either make different crops or stop being farmers" is a lot like "there shouldn\'t be a minimum wage for occupation X, because if they can\'t make ends meet with below minimum wage, they can just quit their job". Being a farmer is a really hard job and people are already paid a pittance for it. One has to remember that the EU isn\'t the US - having large fields that basically go on forever where you efficiently plant mono-culture and then use large machinery to basically automate the cropping process is just not a thing you can do here. (I\'m not entirely finished on the first point, but I\'ll switch over to the second one for now) 2) Yeah, there are all sorts of situations where you would want to sell at a loss, and more likely than not, there are exceptions in the law for exactly those types of situations. I don\'t live in france, so I don\'t know the exact situation, so I can also only quote the article. And the article talks about this law in the context of exactly this type of price dumping, which is something that is illegal in many countries (the US included), as it is a predatory practice that actually harms the market. Now, what you also have to remember is that the EU isn\'t as capitalistic as the US, and it also certainly doesn\'t want to be. The \'economics 101\' you talk about is probably a vastly different one from the one I\'m talking about. From a \'I want a free market at all cost\'-perspective such regulations don\'t make much sense. From a \'society is more than just the economy\'-perspective the absolutely do. Regulations such as these protect the producers from predatory and unsustainable pricing tactics, they prevent the creation of monopolies in the food sector (which, if you take a look at the food quality, is an absolutely desirable thing), they protect/create jobs, and also ultimatively allow non-discount grocery stores to stay competetive (which from a consumer perspective is preferable).',
			'The minimum wage exists for a different reason - though I agree it is a similar reason on the surface. We have a minimum wage specifically to prohibit certain classes of jobs. We don\'t want people who\'s job it is to open doors for people all day. We don\'t want people who\'s job it is to count grains of rice. We want to impose a certain minimum level of efficiency required in the actions of the market. We also want to protect low knowledge workers from exploitative contracts. This rule is to do the opposite - to require a level of inefficiency from the market. I\'m not saying farming isn\'t hard work - I\'m not a farmer and have no idea whether it is or not.  2) What is a situation where a shop would want to sell at a loss, and the law would prevent it, where you would say "well that\'s a bad action by the shop and should be prohibited?" I assume (though perhaps incorrectly) that these are not consignment businesses and the shop buys for X and then can sell for whatever it wants be that X+ or X- but either way the farmer got his X. "Price dumping\' as it is understood and prohibited, is something completely different from what is being described here. Imagine I\'m bill gates and I want to sell Ice Cream. I buy an ice cream plant and I start making Ice Cream. My plan is that I sell my ice cream for $1.00 per tub (5% of what it costs to make). I do this in order to drive my competitors out of business. I lose billions. But after 2 years no one else makes Ice Cream because no one will pay the premium and I am the last one left standing (because I had the deepest pockets). Now I raise prices $100.00 a tub and no one can do anything about it. Someone opens up to compete - I drop prices again until they go under. That\'s illegal dumping. Its an anti-monopoly thing. This isn\'t that.',
			'ockquote> 2) What is a situation where a shop would want to sell at a loss, and the law would prevent it, where you would say "well that\'s a bad action by the shop and should be prohibited?" I assume (though perhaps incorrectly) that these are not consignment businesses and the shop buys for X and then can sell for whatever it wants be that X+ or X- but either way the farmer got his X.  Product pricing is determined between the manufacturer and the retailer, if I\'m not mistaken. There are price floors for certain items as well. If you sold Nutella at a loss every day in your supermarket, it would set a new price standard where people may be unwilling to buy Nutella at its original price. So any absurd 70%+ sale of Nutella is probably condoned by the manufacturer, and is much more like your last paragraph than you probably think.  The reasoning that the French government is offering, however, is kind of muddled. They say it helps farmers, which has to do with price competition. They also say it helps reduce food waste (related to hoarding, maybe?), which is contrary to the point that these sales prevent food spoilage by selling items before expiration. Then they say it\'s to prevent fights in grocery stores.  I\'m not really sure they know what they\'re doing. My first impression was that BOGO offers were being used to circumvent restrictions on pricing products at a loss. But now I\'m not really sure what they\'re up to. ',
			'ockquote> Banning “buy one, get one free” bargains, which are less common in France than in countries such as Britain, will also help fight against food waste, he said.   Um, lowering prices is how you deal with a surplus to avoid waste.  Unless this is a anti competitive dumping situation, which it may be because it looks like the root issue is a supermarket chain used the sale as a loss leader and created black Friday type riots. ',
			'It\'s been investigated and was indeed a price dumping issue. Intermarché is using this not just as a PR stunt, but also as a way to boost cash flow and profit from various credit lines.',
			'What does that mean? How does it "boost cash flow and profit from various credit lines" more than simply having temporarily reduced the price by 50% requiring a minimum 2 quantity? Besides the psychology of getting people excited because they get something "free".',
			'ockquote> Um, lowering prices is how you deal with a surplus to avoid waste.   It just moves the waste from the company to the customer. They\'re talking about people buying more than they need and not using it all.',

			'As a Canadian this is super obvious. Going through high school the entire honours with distinction graduating class (90% or above average) is dominated by first generation kids. Their parents move here for a better life and their kids understand that so they work hard. They\'re also some of the nicest and kindest people you\'ll ever meet so I\'ve become fast friends with many of them ',
			'I would have thought that it was because Canada limits immigration to those who are already highly educated. If you are only going to accept people who are uni/college educated, then your going to obviously have a disproportionately more educated population when compared to other countries. I\'m a first-gen immigrant in Canada, and frankly, I dont know how different my work ethic would be had I just stayed in The Netherlands. Who knows, might just be me.',
			'I think its definitely a bit of both. It\'s true that Canada\'s immigration system favours those who have attained higher education from reputable schools. Some are able to work in their field right away, some of them don\'t have their degree recognized in the Canadian system and are forced to work labour jobs or drive taxis etc even with a doctorate from another country. Either way they are usually well educated. And you can bet the Indian guy with a phd driving a taxi will instill some rigid study habits and self-discipline into his children, thus 1st-gen immigrants usually perform well academically. ',
			'I am an Indian and I immigrated to Canada and I can safely say that you won’t find an Indian with a PhD driving a taxi. You will however find many Indians and Pakistan’s with undergraduate degrees in non stem fields or working part time to finish their masters/graduate degrees driving taxis, Uber etc.',
			'Well as a personal anecdote my former neighbour was a guy from India (or possibly Sri Lanka) and he had a PhD but worked in a factory that produce bottled softdrinks. So I don\'t think it\'s impossible to find a similar story for a cabbie. But I know that India has over 20 institutions recognized in the world directory of medical schools, which is what Canada uses to determine credibility of medical degrees. So you\'re right that most Indian doctors can probably practice medicine here legally, but there is also a long process involving fees and taking special courses to get accredited/licenced to practice medicine here. Some of them may not have the means to go through that process. And some maybe went to a school not on the list of recognized schools',
			'My family was helping out a new family that were refugees from Bosnia. We taught them English and helped them find a car and stuff. They lived in a tiny apartment when they came and had like 500 bucks for a car. My grandpa was a mechanic his whole life so he got it running as best it could. They had virtually no english. Really. None. The father was working at a plant which assembled house windows and the wife stayed at home with their newborn. We just figured they were blue collar workers for quite a while since the father didn\'t talk much. Well after about two years we were having dinner at their place (god I loved those meals) and the topic of college came up. We never asked them about it, because we assumed they never went and didn\'t want it to be awkward. Turns out, the father was an engineer and the wife was a civil engineer. My mom freaks out and gets more information. Turns out the guy worked on designing pipelines, but thought his english would be a barrier to finding work in the US (he was super modest. His English was totally passable). Well, he ended up designing some seal, or connection device between pieces of pipeline, and the family now lives in a giant house with a beautiful garden. Whenever I think of the American dream I think of them. ',

			'We emigrated from the USSR & my dad, with his masters (PHD?) in electrical engineering was worked odd jobs like manual labour in a plastics factory & a janitor. Got an accidental break at a small local engineering firm but the initial work was as an unpaid part-time worker. Same for my mom as a piano teacher with her masters. Worked odd jobs until she found work in a private school. This was well over 20 years ago at the tail end of the Cold War so who knows if that\'s still true today, but I suspect recognition of foreign degrees is still a massive problem, especially for professional licensed degrees.',
			'Probably a tech group/ manufacturing plant would pick them up as cheap engineering/IT techs today. Met a few of them when I was working. It\'s beneficial for both the company (cheap) and the employee (making more money than most blue color work). I\'d guess it would be less likely in the past due to the whole communism scare. They usually move up and get an American equivalent accreditation over time. Note, this is the US experience. Canada is a little more protective in the tech fields.',
			'I disagree that an immigrant would go through all the trouble to obtain residency in Canada only to return to their home country. I’m in school right now with medical dr’s from Brazil, Sri Lanka, Romania, China and none of them can practice medicine in Canada. They’re going to school for acupuncture because it’s a 2 year degree and I guess they can write off a lot of biology courses required for the degree. ',
			'It\'s particularly bizarre for people from Romania. They could practice in all of EU, why the hell would someone choose to learn acupuncture in Canada instead?',
			'ockquote> They would much rather go back to India.  Would that have been different a generation ago? Could you earn more money driving a taxi in Toronto than as a doctor in Mumbai in the 90\'s?',
			'Not sure about the money earned in absolute dollar terms but the you could have a much better lifestyle being a doctor in Mumbai in the 90s compared to a cab driver in Toronto. Also don’t forget for us Indians the type of job you do matters a lot more than the money you earn. Medicine and Engineering was the considered as the most prestigious / sort after career options in the 90s and almost every youngster wanted to be either a doctor or engineer. So it would have been quite frustrating psychologically for a doctor or engineer to drive a taxi in Toronto even if he or she earned more money. And the mentality has not changed much even now and that’s why I said they would prefer to go back.',
			'They may prefer to go back but bite the bullet for their children. Lot of immigrants immigrate so their kids can have better lives.',
			'Exactly. My parents did the same. They\'re from the Philippines which definitely has a lot of issues as a country but they were quite well off (In the philippines, you\'re generally either rich and had like servants and drivers and gated communities or you\'re poor. My parents were rich. Low end rich but still rich). They spent all their money to move to the US and then Canada and worked a lot harder for less money just so my sister and I would grow up in a safer country with better opportunities. My parents still ended up living pretty well here since they did have enough money to get established here without having crippling debt and were able to just work their way up from there but we would definitely have been richer for less work in the Philippines. ',
			'Yes. Often it\'s all for their children. ',
			'I\'m not Indian but marrying one and yeah, the prestige thing can\'t be emphasised enough from what I\'ve seen and been told. Being able to tell people that either you are a doctor or your child is a doctor is a huge deal. It\'s fascinating to see this be critiqued in movies like 3 Idiots and for many Indians to watch the movie and love it but continue practicing that same part of the culture with seemingly no cognitive dissonance.',
			'Personal anecdote: I know two separate Indian people, one is an Indian woman with an advanced degree in medical sciences and used to attend conferences talking about her research, she couldn\'t get a job when she immigrated in Canada and now work in security, the other being a young Indian man with a computer science degree but work at a fast food because he coudn\'t get a job as well. And this is my limited interactions, there are more people out there.',
			'Not every countries educational system is accepted as on par with the host countries. To have a degree that is equally accepted requires a lot of documentation, and then that documentation has to also be acceptable etc. You can run into a lot of issues. Some will need to be tested and they can have problems with a language barrier even if english. Those are some of the reasons why there might be people with PHD\'s that are doing menial jobs. At least for the short term.',
			'Not exactly true. I know an older Indian guy who taught biology for years in India. But after coming to Canada, he considered himself to old to teach or get re-certified. So he drives a cab and tutors university kids on the side. ',
			'My father went to university and got a degree in electrical engineering, Canada accepted him, but none of the companies here accepted recognized his degree, despite having gone to a Swedish (?) run University in Pakistan. He ended up becoming a taxi driver. I sometimes wonder where we would be financially, if his degree was accepted. As it is, we lived a better life here than in Pakistan, but it still was extremely difficult. [Edit]: I should add, before coming to Canada, my dad also worked in the US, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi.',
			'Parents education is predictive of the kid\'s eductions too.',
			'Keep in mind though, many of those whom immigrate to Canada are unable to practice their professions. There are many impediments put in front of them by the protectionist associations in this country. From medical, engineering, mining, you name it. Canada is an awesome country, I am extremely lucky to be able to call this my home. However, they are doing the both Canada and the world a disservice by bringing the best, but not allowing them to practice their degrees and expertise. There have been several stories about this, from one of Iran’s top surgeons being a baker in Toronto, to me working alongside a nuclear engineer in a construction site. I once saw a newsletter from the steelworkers union, they vehemently opposed foreigners being hired at the coal mines of B.C. ',
			'I totally agree. I know many immigrants who aren\'t able to work in regulated occupations (mostly mining since that\'s my industry) because their education isn\'t recognised. I was educated in the UK so I didn\'t have issues - aside from the length of time it took to get my qualifications assessed - but it still amazed me that the standard of my UK education was even in doubt. It\'s kind of crazy that someone who got shit marks at a Canadian uni can walk into a job relatively easily but someone who has a good foreign education and years of experience has to jump through hoops. I\'m not sure what the answer is with respect to how this is assessed for regulated occupations but the current system is failing Canada IMO.',
			'There\'s also the issue that not all degrees have the same requirements or cover the same topics. Some countries have MD programs that aren\'t at the standard required for Canada MD programs.  My fiancées parents immigrated from South Africa. Her dad was a doctor, and her mom a nurse. The MD degree transferred but the nursing degree didn\'t. This was because the nursing degree requirements weren\'t the same between the countries. ',
			'This happened to my family, they were invited to come stay because my uncle was excelling and he had a few choices of countries and chose Canada, Which brought the whole family from egypt.',
			'This is the correct answer.',
			'For me the biggest shocker was not how intelligent they are but their drive. As a kid from a upper middle class that lives in the gta I’ve never found that motivation myself. Even while being on honour roll every year of high school with a high 80 average and passing everything in university (compsci) I feel as though I do it to not disappoint others instead of further myself. I can honestly say majority of these immigrant students make mediocrity feel incompetent and I think that’s due to the newly installed complacency within my generation that’s come with instant gratification and sheltering.',
			'I don\'t know about that for sure. I myself grew up with immigrant parents and so did many of the kids in my area. There\'s definitely tonnes of guilt and this need to not disappoint those around you. It\'s not uncommon for many kid\'s parents to start saving for their college funds at an early age regardless of their chances for a higher education. ',
			'This is incredibly common because it was culturally acceptable to shield your kids from the realities of adult life and raising a family. You never saw how hard your parents worked because they hid it form you but they absolutely worked their asses off. That sentiment is changing, its ok to show your kids how you work to achieve things and the failure/success that comes with.',
			'I\'ve personally befriended at least half a dozen immigrants that came here because their parents wanted a better life for their family. Not only do the parents do well in staying out of poverty, the friends I\'ve made all seem to be taking advantage of what they simply never had in their home country. Countless, and I mean countless opportunities for them to succeed here in Canada. They\'re all hard workers too, it\'s not just their grades that do exceedingly well, it\'s their ambition. I\'ve worked with them, socialized and went on trips. They are certainly grateful of what this country has to offer them, and they are gracious enough to apply themselves and find a way to pay it back. I\'m Native American and I welcome foreigners to this land. Yet a lot of my peers and family who don\'t strive for anything in life are discontent with immigrants working here or getting educated. I have some white friends who take on the "Trump" mentality towards foreigners, it pisses me off, this is Canada. This is my ancestor\'s homeland. I personally don\'t mind immigrants, they do well and I envy their hardships. ',
			'I had a similar experience in my school as well. We had an IB program at the time and it was something I didn\'t even think about until meeting those who really did. I didn\'t realize how much I took my school for granted until getting to know some of the others in my class who were immigrants. ',
			'Why isn\'t that the case in Europe though, where many kids of certain cultural backgrounds severely lack behind in education?',
			'It is mainly because, in Canada the migration is merit based. I recently migrated to Canada. I have an Engineering degree and 4 years experience as a software engineer in my home country.',
			'Canada is somewhat of an island. We have a well funded(comparatively) immigration bureau that can be demanding to get past - we want people who want to be here ',
			'I don’t expect you to have the absolute answer but why does the US get shit on for not letting everyone in? ',
			'As an example, when Canada is looking at immigrants or refugees from muslim countries, we favour education and families. When we bring in families, we try to position them in small communities and integrate them. This is possible because of a well funded immigration program - generally these families are well accepted in their communities, and the communities want them to succeed. We try to pull in full families all at once.',
			'what was the process like?',
			'It is lengthy and you have to get really good marks for the Language test exam. It took me more than 12 months for the whole process to complete. ',
			'My guess is Canada\'s merit system. Or maybe you are comparing immigrants and refugees, because immigrants typically are required to be educated and often middle class whereas refugees, generally speaking, are lower class and come from rural families and often come with baggage',
			'Why don\'t we model our USA immigration system after Canada? They seem to have their shit together. A merit based system that favors highly educated applicants. ',
			'The U.S should adopt Canada’s system. Clearly immigration reform is needed. But instead of framing it as “We need a system like Canada has”, it’s “We’d rather have people from Norway instead of shithole countries”.  Immigration reform honestly doesn’t have to be that complicated but neither side wants to compromise.  Give Dreamers and those with protections a path to citizenship with the same standards as other applicants. Just waive the clause where they have to leave the country first.  End the lottery and focus on a merit based system.  The lottery is useless in the sense that even if someone wins, if they don’t meet the qualifications they don’t get a green card anyways. ',
			'The lottery is system is crap but its also been blown way out of proportion. Only 5% of the green cards are given out through lottery. A huge chunk of the green cards are for family reunification. The gang of 8 bill passed in 2013 did away with the lottery and wanted to put in a points based system.',
			'When I came to Canada the country and most people in it accept me. The country offered a comfortable and fast (4 years) path to citizenship. I was told Canada is multicultural and I should feel free in being an Afghan Canadian. I didn\'t feel rejected. I didn\'t seek a ghetto to belong to. My connection with Afghanistan did not ostracized me from Canadian society. I faced of course many types and cases of racism but the feeling of acceptance was stronger. I self confidently chose then to enter Canadian society in a professional capacity rather than choosing to work a cash job, in a insulated community. In my experience European immigrants don\'t get that opportunity.',
			'Thanks for saying that. There are many Canadians like me (60F)who welcome immigrants. I lived in southeast Asia for four years, so I know what it is like to feel foreign.  As a rule, I don\'t equate anyone with the stereotypes from their culture. They have already left it. I became an ESL teacher so I could explain Canadian culture and language to newcomers.  Our true culture is empathy and acceptance, at least I hope so. My ancestors came here from England, on both sides, and my husband\'s came from Ireland during the potato famine. Welcome. We can build a better Canada together. ',
			'Thanks. I absolutely agree. I plan to raise my future family here as Canadians and teaching them first and foremost those same values of empathy and acceptance.',
			'Great to hear about your experience. I\'m Canadian but live in the US. My kid was born in the US, making her an American citizen. Yet, my American friends still consider her to be Canadian and not American. It\'s odd.  Trudeau welcoming \'home\' Syrian refugees makes me tear up every time. ',
			'Yep! That\'s exactly it.',
			'You’ve never met Asian parents in the UK? They demand all their kids become lawyers or doctors.',
			'Same in the US, definitely when I was in college in the 90\'s. The joke then, that pretty much every kid in school would immediately "get", was that in practically every class there was an Asian kid who\'d get perfect marks on everything and screw up the grading curve for everyone else.  I found that to be entirely true studying business and accounting, though I admired it rather than resented it.',
			'Yeah, where is this guy living? No English son of a taxi driver or convenience store owner would ever go to uni- but every single Asian child in that family would. The emphasis on “tooshun” is absolute. Or you get the beats.',
			'Because to get a Visa to Canada you have to have skills, almost like a merit based system, or something else. Many of my friends are in Canada and they have to be in demand. To get into Europe , you just have to have legs',
			'To get into Europe , you just have to have legs lol',
			'Canada is surrounded by water, USA and ice. The obvious result for that is that the number of refugees is so small that it can be pretty much ignored. What\'s left are the immigrants that enter due to their merit system. The people that enter like this are all educated and they came from countries that are worse off. Educated parents are more likely to have kids that end up doing well in school and them being from a worse off country means that they know how good they have it now and put more pressure on their children to do good in school. Europe on the other hand is connected to too many countries. Be it the middle east, africa (by boat), Turkey, Russia, etc. These countries can also all be unsafe for people, and some European countries won\'t send back refugees that may get killed. (For example, a gay Saudi arriving in Germany won\'t be send back to Saudi Arabia) This causes many poor people to arrive in Europe, often with little education. And when they arrive in Germany then everything is new to them, they don\'t even understand the language. The numbers are also often way higher than those in Canada. Thus these people form groups with similar immigrants, because that way they can be among similar people, which is something they\'re used to. This however causes the integration to be lacking. Especially considering how many refugees arrived in Europe recently. (They\'re refugees, but I doubt that many of them will leave) Of course, in Europe there are also immigrants similar to those in Canada. It may be someone that arrived in Germany to go to university, since his country doesn\'t have any good ones and ended up staying afterwards, for example after finding a significant others. People like them are often from a better background and are well educated. They generally integrate better. TL;DR: Few high educated immigrants integrate better than many with lacking education.',
			'That may be true, but Canada works hard to integrate its immigrants and refugees. ESL classes, training programs, and a lack of discrimination that I know exists all over Europe.  I had a German friend that absolutely hated Turks. She said that German employers would hire a German over a Turk every time because they knew the German would always be on time.  Canada isn’t free from discrimination but it’s mainly “can you speak English well enough to the job”. ',
			'Many of these different circumstances come from the different situations. For example, your point about discrimination. Isn\'t that the result of an issue with integration and education? And the issue that Europe has with integration and education I\'ve already explained above. Europe also has support for immigration, but don\'t forget that the people that arrive are completly different. As Europe has more immigrants and less educated ones, the integration would obviously become more difficult. I do however know that the ones in Europe are currently way over capacity. And the most important point for integration isn\'t the help systems in place, but the will of the person involved. It can only show people the door, but they need to go through it themselves.',
			'The Chinese families that come to Canada are largely from the top 10% socioeconomically in China. The refugees that come to Europe are largely from the bottom 50%. If you take people from the bottom 50% of China you would see similar trends. Not to mention China is a more well off country in general that the African or Middle Eastern nations those refugees come from. The top 10% of China will have better socioeconomic metrics than the top 10% from those nations.',
			'Maybe that top 10% from China is the new trend because most of the children of Chinese immigrants from my cohort (early to mid twenties) come from rather poor socioeconomic backgrounds. The stereotype Asian parent who wants you to be frugal and wants you to get a good education didn\'t pop up in response to wealthy Chinese immigrants (or maybe its a Cantonese thing).',
			'No. This is the case. Rich kids don\'t value higher education nor do their parents unless they\'re getting into politics/politically inclined or want the respect of normies. The top 10% of China isn\'t contributing to the stats of Canada, they have it good in China and stay just having properties in multiple locations overseas.  The people going to school want jobs, they don\'t have family money ususally. ',
			'ockquote> Rich kids don\'t value higher education   I talk to a lot of rich Asians from Vancouver everyday, not only are they highly educated but still work Full time and even two jobs. They\'re hardworking regardless of how much money they or their parents have.',
			'The kids references are from my generation or so. The big mass migration from China happened in the 80s a d it was a lot of poorer southerners like my family. Your thinking of more recent stats when Canada tightened it\'s rules enormously under Harper. ',
			'Because  A) You can\'t just take a boat to canada from the middle east. B) We have less strict rules about who to accept in. C) A lot of the people who come here aren\'t planning on living here for their whole lives. D) Language barriers with countries who doesn\'t use english as their main language. ',
			'ockquote> D) Language barriers with countries who doesn\'t don\'t use english as their main language.  I\'m definitely being pedantic here, but in the context of what you\'re arguing it had to be corrected.',
			'The US needs to emulate Canada\'s immigration system.',
			'For one, Canada isn\'t bordered by Mexico which dramatically simplifies their immigration debate. ',
			'As much as I think this is an uplifting story I also can\'t help but think geography is also a big factor. This is also a thing in the EU. Immigrants should apply in the country they first arrive in. Needless to say a lot of countries at the borders of the EU aren\'t thrilled. Those boats from Africa aren\'t going to land in central/northwestern countries. They always land in the Mediterranean countries. Eventually they split up the burden that comes with housing, education, etc., but in the meanwhile the border countries have no choice but to deal with it immediately. Arranging temporary housing, food, security, medical care, screening people.. Unfortunately there is little to do about it except for helping to provide those countries with the means to handle it, since you can\'t very well change geography.',
			'Canada\'s immigration policy is far stricter then the US. So yes we should',
			'The US should emulate many Canadian policies. Education and Health.',
			'The US actually ranks higher than us in the UN Education Index and they\'re not too far behind in the population with tertiary education (they\'re still in the top 10), which is the subject of this article. They definitely need to get on universal healthcare, though.',
			'I could be wrong, but isn\'t that what they\'re proposing more of now? I\'ve heard a lot more talk recently of merit based immigration.',
			'Of course, they have some of the strictest immigration standards, and only accept well educated immigrants. Edit: Well educated immigrants is a bit of hyperbole. strict standards nonetheless.',
			'Christ, we hired a guy from Syria for winter help at my tire shop and the dude has a engineering degree from back home. He\'s currently busting his ass off to save up and go back to school to become an accountant. Guy saw a lot of shit back at home and is the most thankful dude I\'ve ever met. Dude would thank me a million times over a $2.00 coffee I gave him. Made me realize I take everything here for granted. Who ever gave me gold, thank you. That\'s a nice surprise',
			'Similar story... I worked at an ambulance factory as grunt/welder when I was 19. I made $16.50/hr which wasn\'t too bad back then, especially for someone who could barely read a tape.  The other "grunt" welder was a Philippino that came here on a work program, and was only being paid $12.50/hr. He was a freaking welding instructor for the last 20 years in the Philippines. He could tig weld pop cans together with his eyes closed, quite literally. He could listen to the rhythm and sounds of the welds to know what he was doing with his hands. ',

And if shit hits the fan in China, like Xi\'s current "war against corruption" (lol) then they can grab their family and escape to Canada.

In order to apply for immigration in Canada, you need to prove that you have enough cash saved so that you won\'t rely on government assistance. You also need to have a job lined up already and have your employer/family there vouch for you. So this makes sense to me. Canada doesn\'t really have the same immigration as other countries, like low-skilled agricultural workers. So all of their immigrants come in with cash nest eggs, which basically implies that they hold a good job. Which basically implies that they are highly educated. ',

Sometimes their country isn\'t even at war or something, they just want to escape the social and economic problems of their home country.

It sure was not the natives. Immigrants. People wanting nothing more than a chance at becoming an American.

I was forced to give up my employment while my work permit lapsed waiting for permanent residency (basically a green card). When I first heard that the Syrian Refugees were being issues residency cards on arrival to Canada from the camps I am shamed to say that I was really upset for about 45 seconds based on my long experience.  Since then I’ve felt shame at my initial reaction and thought about just what a relief that must be after facing so much.

What is the necessary population for a country\'s survival? Isn\'t an ever-increasing population actually a significant problem? Could it be that Italy\'s population is headed towards an optimal population size for its current economic and social conditions (i.e. resource constraints such as housing and jobs)? I understand that a declining population can cause issues for countries that rely on a wage tax to subsidize benefits for retired people, but doesn\'t this just highlight weaknesses in this model? Furthermore, is it rational to assume that an uneducated adult immigrant would be likely to be a net positive contributor to taxes? Note that well educated immigrants are far less likely to arrive illegally and child immigrants, if able to join a local education system, would constitute a significant additional burden for years before becoming productive members of society. It seems that there is no strong argument that the majority of illegal immigrants are a "net positive", at least in a financial sense. That said, I certainly understand the humanitarian aspects of desperate immigrants, but that isn\'t the argument you were making.',

			'So there are a few issues with why cows produce so much methane and co2 as opposed to the millions and millions of other mammals that were around he pre-industrial revolution.  The feed they eat is corn-based, which is a cost (and arguably taste) based decision. Their stomachs didn’t evolve to digest grain so they release more gases. The pastureland they are raised on when they do eat grasses (most cows start eating grasses and move to grains to be fattened up for slaughter) have been stripped of the original perennial prairie grasses in favor of annual, short root and cheap grasses. The cattle aren’t sufficiently rotated on the pastureland, so they are allowed to completely strip a field of grass, causing nutrients and carbon to wash out during rains into the streams and rivers, adding to the carbon emissions and removing the nutrients that would allow stronger and more sustainable plants to grow.  There are some new farming practices (literally called carbon farming) that involve pure grass fed beef, with perennial grasses, such as chicory, that have deep tap roots that can keep carbon in the soil. This combined with rotation that allows the grasses to recover actually has the potential to completely neutralize the carbon emissions of livestock.

			'Hello there! If you\'re reading this post, you may be interested in reducing your impact on the environment. There are some easy steps that you can take to help the environment. 1. Say No to Straws Seriously, just say no. They’re an unnecessary disposable plastic that ultimately just ends up polluting more than the personal convenience is worth. You can drink from the glass, and if you really like straws you can buy reusable ones made of metal, glass, or bamboo.  2. Stop using plastic bottles Water is great, but disposable bottles are not. Metal, glass, and hard plastic water bottles are all great for filling up with tap water and carrying in your bag. If you don’t like the taste of tap water, you can always buy a filtering pitcher or a filtering attachment for certain water bottles. In most parts of the country it is easier to recycle aluminum and glass than plastic. So next time you buy a non-water drink please consider buying one that’s packaged in a can or in a glass bottle.  3. Ditch disposable plates and utensils If you use disposable plates and utensils on a daily basis, please buy a real plate. You can find them at any thrift shop if you feel you can’t afford it. If you’re using disposables because you don’t like washing dishes, it only takes about 10 minutes. As for utensils at fast food restaurants or food trucks you can bring metal ones from home and wash them at home. 4. Go Outside Not only does being near nature make you happier, it helps to remind us all of why we should care about the environment. 5. Think before you buy Before you buy anything, you should think “Do I really need this?”. In addition to saving the environmental cost of resource extraction, manufacturing, and shipping, it will also save you money.  6. Try to line dry clothes When it’s warm and not humid outside, line drying saves you money in electricity. Your clothes will also smell nice and setting up a line isn’t difficult. 7. Try meatless mondays Animal agriculture is pretty bad for the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, water use, etc. I know most people aren’t up for a completely vegan lifestyle, so try being vegetarian once a week. It’ll reduce your carbon footprint and you’ll probably end up trying new foods. 8. Try reusable produce bags They\'re easy to sew yourself, but if that isn\'t your cup of loose-leaf tea you can buy them online or at some stores. This will reduce the 3-4 plastic produce bags you probably use every time you go grocery shopping. Its small, but adds up over time If you got down here, thanks for reading! Every step counts, and your good example and lead others to make positive changes as well. ',

Even if every American started recycling and driving a Tesla, global warming wouldn\'t change.  There\'s simply too many people to stop something as big as this, even when working together. Too many people who are apathetic and will fund the companies destroying the Earth anyway (how can you not at this point?). Not to mention there\'s some 7 billion people and only a fraction of them are Americans, a huge majority couldn\'t give less of a shit and probably don\'t even know about the plight polar bears face.  The only way this shit changes is by being forced to change, and as we\'ve all learned with the FCC recently, we don\'t have a say anymore.

It ends at the top when they finally make legislative decisions. What I don\'t understand about climate change deniers is that there is nothing to lose in helping the cause. The only people "losing" to climate change awareness are fossil fuel interests, religious groups, and ignorant people who listen to these groups. Fossil fuel interests have served their purpose but it\'s time to evolve away from that. Religious groups believe in the unseeable but don\'t believe in climate change because they can\'t see it.

			'Yeah... but jevons paradox is right in this case. Because it is more efficient and faster people fly farther. 50 years ago no one was flying to Asia for vacations... A single intercontinental roundtrip flight is 180 gallons per pax to Asia. A 1000mile roadtrip for four in a hummer is 14 gallons. Vacation locally, go explore your own continent. A roundtrip for four in any recent crossover would cut that in half. While flying is more efficient when comparing driving to fly directly for the same trip and only if the the car is a single driver... Just change the trip. But even that is changing. According to the FAA the fleet average is 75mpg per pax. If you take a Ford Edge which gets 29mpg highway, and put 4 people in it the car is better. On average 100 pounds reduces mileage by 2% or in this case 0.6mpg. If each adult weighs 180# and has 50# of luggage that is 690# in excess weight for the 3 extra pax or a 4.14mpg reduction.  With 4 pax that gives you 25mpg for yhe vehicle or 100mpg per pax. Which is better than almost all major jets on the market. If you have an electric vehicle the comparison gets silly.

Almost all campaigners against climate change also campaign for action on those problems, and pressure is constantly being applied to try to tackle them, you just don\'t hear much about it in the press because the issues are more fragmented and difficult to pick up on. For instance, there has been a huge programme of reform in fisheries over the last five years in the EU, a lot of marine reserves created, the licensing system rewritten. Similarly there\'s been a huge amount of action on microbeads and plastics pollution within the last year. But neither issue is reported much. People prefer to read about political controversies, for which you can pick a side and enjoy some easy outrage.',
			'Or maybe the polar bear population has rebounded to a level that reflects the carrying capacity of their environment. Fifty years ago, there were less than half as many polar bears as there are now. I\'m uncertain as to how global warming affected the population then, but I don\'t see it mentioned often. Now that they are starving because of global warming, there are far more bears roaming the Arctic. How does that work? A large, long lived top predator increases its numbers for decades, and then the population levels off. Bears are starving. Well, that\'s the fate of some of the members of a population of predators who are killing all of their prey that the environment can sustain. How is every dead polar bear a symptom of global warming, when their population as a species is not in danger?',

			'The polar bear population is estimated to be five times as large as it was in the 1950s and more than double the estimates for 1965-1970. The polar bear population may have decreased since the mid 80s, but only slightly. So, apparently, the bears are doing quite well, overall.',

I’m also skeptical that a lack of data supporting polar bear population size is evidence against their vulnerability to sea ice reduction.

Compare this to Kensington high street where the cycle highway stops and it is absolute chaos!',
			'Pardon me if I\'m just saying foolishness, but it seems to be that it\'s self explication why less car lanes will lead to more congestion.

			'ockquote> it seems to be that it\'s self explication why less car lanes will lead to more congestion  Not if more bike lanes encourage more people to cycle instead of drive. The whole point of transit and cycle-oriented city planning is to remove cars from the road in favor of other methods of transport. You can also speed up single-lane traffic by reducing wait points such as at intersections. Many city streets don\'t have left or right turn lanes, so entire lanes of traffic are blocked by people turning, and the turners are blocked by other cars and pedestrians. It\'s a nightmare! If you remove a lane of traffic and build the road to accommodate bikes and turn lanes, traffic may flow more freely.',
			'That\'s a mixed picture but under most cases the bike is either neutral or positive when it comes to reducing pollution and traffic.  First bikes don\'t give out polution they are being used. Second it would take 364,520 bike trips to equal the road damage caused by just one trip with Hummer H2. Third, the space a bike uses is a lot less than space a person who drives a car occupies. Therefore more bikes mean more open roads which under certain circumstance lessen traffic and pollution. But, to use an extreme example a bike taking a lane on a fast moving highway. Never mind the dangers, would cause an insane amount pollution by causing a huge number of vehicles to slow down and speed up by both passing the bike and the traffic ripples that it would also cause. ',

That is what is most dangerous about them. They are idealists and are fighting for their ideals and not anything material. Unfortunately when their ideals are unrealistic and impractical, all this achieves is making the situation worse. I\'ve spoken to many of them. They are all basically of the opinion that while they have no chance of winning, it is better than fight than to sit back and accept the situation. Unfortunately this is where I disagree because I think fighting makes things even worse. It gives China an excuse to take control and take drastic measures. China isn\'t that interested in taking control of Hong Kong - we\'re just not that important. They\'ll implement some farcical democratic system to keep some satisfied and retain face, and they\'ll make sure they\'re in control, however they\'re fine with HK governing themselves for the most part if things run smoothly. However if we raise enough of a fuss they will be forced to really take control , and who\'s going to stop them? ',

They have never had the need to consider is throwing tantrum the best way forward or what will happen after it. This became their default strategy for everything despite what they education taught them.  Reddit wants to blame quality of education every problem but it isn\'t the root. The root of the problem is quality of people being educated. ',
			'If the two options (protests vs. effecting change while in a governmental position) were both equally possible, I would agree that doing it the legal way may be better. The issue is that getting to a position in the government while believing in maintaining HK autonomy, at least until 2047, and HK culture is quickly looking to be impossible.  I disagree that all supporters of occupy central were raised throwing tantrums outside malls for mainly personal reasons such as knowing them or their parents (not the kind of people who would put up with tantrums, and I suspect anyone with Asian parents would know what I\'m talking about ;) ). But even if that were true, judging a political ideal or philosophy based on the actions of its supporters seems a tad illogical. Should we not be judging it on its own merits, on how it could benefit the society in which it is applied? ',

This is huge, hugely esteemed by Beijing. China itself is going to change immensely over the next few decades in any case. ',

			'For those too lazy to do the very basic research on this before shitposting: Govt of HK under British rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong Govt of HK now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong  I\'ll summarize for those to lazy to bother reading: HK, being a colony, was ruled by a governor appointed by London. No office in the entire colonial govt was elected by the locals, not one. Now we have a legislature and an executive office. Both are elected by locals. The legislature is elected by universal suffrage. The Chief Executive (our President) is elected by an electoral college of 1200 people, local academics, business leaders etc. The Umbrella Movement wasn\'t to "bring democracy to HK". You can\'t bring us something we already have. They were protesting Beijing\'s new power to veto candidates for the Presidential race, a power they never actually exercised. There was some support for the kids leading this movement back in 2014, but now no one with a full time job supports them. We just had another round of Presidential elections and Beijing didn\'t veto anyone and it went just like it always does. Except we elected a lady, a first for us. The Umbrella kids lost any remaining support when their two pro-independence Legco (our Congress) members trolled their own swearing ceremony by calling Chinese people "Shina", which is a Japanese racial slur for all Chinese people (including HKers). This got them disqualified (obviously). Now these kids are asking for the release of documents regarding the 1967 riots (that\'s what the article is about if you bothered to read it, which I\'m sure most of you did not). I have no idea why seeing as how those riots were an anti-colonial uprising against the British. The rumor is that the PLA almost invaded HK to support the protesters but no one know for sure, the PLA isn\'t the type of organization that announces their intentions to the public. ',
			'Best comment in the thread.',

			'I would agree with the vast majority of the above, however, you have somewhat played down the importance of the group and the political leaning of the \'Election Committee\' which you refer to as the electoral college.  Whilst I wouldn\'t disagree with the point that it includes local academics and business leaders, the members of the EC are broadly regarded to be sympathetic to the mainland government particularly due to the influence the mainland has on the economy and business interests of the territory (and those in the committee). In this respect, those which where proponents of the Umbrella Movement felt that their section of society where underrepresented within this cross section utilised to elect the Chief Executive.  The previous Chief Executive, Leung Chun-Ying, was widely unpopular with the electorate.  Thanks. ',
			'ockquote> the members of the EC are broadly regarded to be sympathetic to the mainland government particularly due to the influence the mainland has on the economy and business interests of the territory (and those in the committee).  And?  If you do business with mainland China, as nearly all HK businesses do, wouldn\'t you be in favor of facilitating that business? These people also employ most everyone in HK, including me. I\'d like for my company to keep doing well, call me crazy.',
			'No I wouldn\'t dare call you crazy, all I\'m pointing out is that there is another layer to your position beyond that which you cared to elaborate.  I would point out that there are interests beyond that of the strictly economic which should have a voice in such a group. It\'s static nature also provides far more power to certain factions of industry. Agriculture and Fisheries, for example, have 60 seats where the sector only makes up less than 1% of the entire economy of Hong Kong, thus not being broadly representative of HKSAR\'s economic realities.  (aside) My firm also conducts a lot of business with Chinese firms, I too have interest in close relations with China. That interest should not be confused with a wish to see that the people of Hong Kong have a proper representation in the electoral system and as such facilitate fair elections which represent the electorate.  That\'s my only point, I feel this aspect of the Committee should be shared for completeness and correctness. Thank you very much for the above reply, you seemed to have done much to educate people on the nature of democracy in Hong Kong. I hope my addition facilitates further discussion and enhances understanding of the political landscape in Hong Kong with as little bias as possible.  Thanks for reading. ',
			'The sad fact is that the vast majority of people who comment on this thread have no idea what\'s going on and he MSM doesn\'t seem interested in ever providing any background when they report on this topic.  I\'m guessing\'t it\'s because the "brave, freedom loving, students fighting for democracy against evil Chinese communist dictatorship" meme sells a lot better than what\'s actually going in reality. It says a lot about why it\'s a better idea to restrict the pool of people who are given the privilege to vote. The average person just isn\'t capable of understanding the complex issues of the modern world.',
			'So not too different from the Governor General positions held in both Canada and Australia. They are appointed by the King/Queen of the UK, and have the power to dismiss prime ministers - much like how you\'ve described this veto power.',
			'And damage their relationship with China? why would they do that?',
			'I\'m not sure what exactly in particular these activists are looking for from the achieve. Some of the more fundamental questions, like why the colonial Government didn\'t prepare HK for democracy earlier, have already been addressed (because CCP threatened with force and the British knows HK is very hard to defend geographically, especially the colony is so far from homeland). The folks at Hong Kong Watch have mentioned about the possibility of granting British Citizenship\'s rights to holders of British National Oversea passport. It may still be very far fetched but at least not as far fetched as realizing a democratic Hong Kong through disclosing archive files.',
			'Moreover, I\'m willing to bet there\'s a fair amount of dirty laundry in those files and that Britain would rather avoid the embarrassment. This ideal of a democratic Hong Kong never really existed in actuality, and by some metrics, such as percentage of population with suffrage, HK is more democratic than it was under the British. ',
			'Then it begs the question of what these activists want to do with these dirty laundry. Care to enlighten us on that? Please don\'t tell me they want to blackmail the Brits.',
			'They probably haven\'t considered that, I think they more or less operate under the idea that any publicity is good publicity. ',
			'The U.K. that\'s in the progress of leaving the EU because of immigration issues granting millions the right to immigrate to the UK. Now that\'s a grand fantasy above the hope that documents will stop China. ',
			'The irony is that Hong Kong was ruled by racially appointed despotic governors until it was transferred to Chinese control. It does not have a history of democratic rule under the United Kingdom. If the PRC instituted the English system used to govern Hong Kong while it was occupied, there would be an outcry. At least it is no longer racially subjugated.',

But most people in this thread probably won\'t understand it and just upvote because they saw "democracy".',
			'naive',
			'Why the fuck should China care whether the legal documents from some hostile foreign government illegally annexing and occupying their land say? This is utterly bizarre. It\'s like Polish separatists saying they want legal documents from occupying Nazi Germany to prove their part of the country isn\'t really Polish. Bizarre.',
			'It was immoral for the British to annex Hong Kong. How was it illegal? That\'s a somewhat modern concept. I\'m not aware of any international law forbidding annexation 1841.',
			'China, the sovereign ruler over Hong Kong, did not willingly give control over the region to the British. You think China didn\'t have laws forbidding hostile powers to invade their country at that time?',
			'ockquote> China, the sovereign ruler over Hong Kong  Yes and China became ruler of Hong Kong by illegally annexing it. And so on and so forth back in time. You can talk about whether annexation/invasion is right or wrong, but debating it\'s legality is pointless.',
			'It is currently illegal to annex territory under Article 2 clause 4 of the United Nations Charter, which is in force today:  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations  As far as I know, no such international laws existed in the 1840s. There\'s an important distinction between international law (the laws governing interactions between multiple sovereign nations) and domestic laws (the laws by which sovereign nations govern themselves). That\'s why I wrote that it was immoral, but not illegal. It wasn\'t illegal under British law, or international law, for the British to annex HK.  If sovereign foreign countries were subject to the domestic laws passed unilaterally by other countries, then the British could have just passed a law through their parliament declaring Hong Kong to be theirs, and that would be the end of it. Obviously that\'s silly, which is why they had to make the Chinese sign a peace treaty with them. It was brutal and immoral; based on the "might-makes-right" mentality of the day; and it certainly would be illegal in modern times under international law, but it was not illegal back then. ',
			'ockquote> illegally annexing and occupying  The whole point of annexing or invading land is that it\'s illegal. If you can get what you want legally, there\'s no need to march in the army and occupy territory. I agree China is unlikely to care, though.',
			'I dislike that I am pointing this out but no amount of "unseen files" are going to stop a military superpower like China from exerting its will on Hong Kong.',
			'That would make sense if it wasnt that the same military of China is the fucking same military of Hong Kong. China doesnt need military force, they already got hong kong by the balls. The reason why hong kong is so successful is bc most of the goods from china go through hong kong. And the independent movement is not popular in hong kong, most of them are just students with no job that want to be che guevarra. ',
			'It\'s funny because like you said, HK rose to its wealth because it served as a trading city between China and much of the rest of the world. Today, its economy is strong but that\'s basically because of Chinese goods flowing through there still. HK as an independent city state wouldn\'t last at all, no matter how much they dream of it. Forget talking about a strong economy. How are they even going to get power and clean drinking water?',
			'Hows Macau doing compared to Hong Kong in all of this?',
			'They have 9000 MOP (~1100 UD) hush money annually going for them, so that\'s nice.',
			'I lived in China ~6 years, Hong Kong 1 year, and Macau 6 months. Go to Hong Kong and call taxi drivers Chinese, they\'ll say "No, I\'m HongKongnese". Go to Macau and ask them if they\'re from Macau and they\'ll say they\'re from China.',
			'Macau largely liberated itself even before it was repatriated to China. In 1967 there was a rash of riots in HK as people tried to rise up against colonial rule. But it was crushed by the British. In Macau, they tried the same thing a few years later. Unlike the British, the Portuguese just threw up their arms and were like "OK, you guys win".',
			'"Macanese people" in Macau refers to a minority of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent',
			'TIL that galinha à africana has a lot of Chinese, European Portuguese, and colonial Portuguese influence in one dish.',
			'What would that do? So the former drug pushing imperialist tenant had bunch of old papers that may make Beijing look bad to the foreign world, as if Beijing would care your former colonialist friends\'s view.  These bunch of lazy Starbucks revolutionaries are pathetic and cowardice, since when any revolution can succeed on outsiders\' goodwill? Or maybe they are just running low on domestic support. ',
			'They are not lazy Starbucks revolutionists. They have and are still taking direct and daring action against the Chinese government from protests to forming government parties, running in elections etc. They also do have a lot of supporters. So I definitely wouldn\'t call them cowardly.  That\'s what\'s most dangerous about them though, they\'re brave, reckless and idealistic, and hence have no regard for practical consequences. IMO this sort of thing is what will destroy Hong Kong. Trying to push an ideal with no regard for practicality never ends well. ',
			'Don\'t know about the first part, totally agree with your second part, and that\'s why I\'m skeptical about these.  The fact is that the only thing they\'ve achieved so far is set Hong Kong\'s economy back at least a decade, which in term translate to job losses, and it\'s the lower tier majority of the society suffer most.',
			'This isn\'t going to happen, and even if it does it\'s unlikely to lead to anything that the activists think it will. No nation has the balls to risk trade relations by going up against China directly, the current status of Taiwan has already proven this. ',

This is what you get when you have children running amuck, being fueled by US demotist agitprop.

			'There\'s not a quick and easy answer.  There have been bad acts from both sides. The modern conflict stems from the aftermath of WWII, the Holocaust and the UK relinquishing its\' colonies. The UN established a committee which produced a report (in 1947) that advised a division of the area and creating an internationally governed area for Jerusalem. The Israelis accepted the result, the Palestinians did not as they wished for a single state for the entire area. Now, Israelis had already been moving to the area prior to that but after that report a civil war broke out (1947-1948) and in May that year the Israelis declared their independence. After that, well.. a lot more bloodshed and misery followed. As an outsider it is far more interesting to see how one might improve the situation bit by bit instead of seeing the situation deteriorate.  As it stands, Israel clearly has far more power and if allowed to continue, the right-wing governments may end up diminishing the Palestinians\' remaining land and power to the effect that they do not need to fear anything the Palestinians might attempt. That last bit is speculation of course. I would think it is imperative that both peoples end up having a place to live in peace and prosperity and to realise that (if it is at all possible) Israel needs to unilaterally take the first steps (which probably requires accepting at least some amount of risk). And that with time, patience and continued attempts to normalise relations between the peoples the Palestinians may see that they have a greater chance of living a normal life with decent facilities who knows..? I mean, this conflict has been going for a long time, but I imagine that regular people on either side would prefer to just be able to lead a normal life. And I\'d say they deserve it. -edit- I mean, it\'s not as if I mean to suggest that the resentment, fear, anger, loss, traumas and stories will be easily gone and forgotten. But still, what can one do other than try?',
			'Not a bad summary though I\'d point out 2 things:   There already was a functioning Jewish proto-state decades before th Holocaust. The Holocaust certainly brought many around to supporting the idea of a Jewish state, the only reason Israel came into being was because Jews declared statehood and then won the war that was forced on them. Israel already tried unilateralism twice: first when it withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and then again when it withdrew from Gaza & 4 settlements in Samaria in 2005. Israelis then went to the polls and voted in Kadima, a party whose sole reason for being was to replicate the Disengagement in the west bank. However then the Palestinians went to the polls and voted in Hamas and shortly after that Hezbollah started the Second Lebanon War.   Israel does have more power so it is reasonable to expect it to take risks for peace. However most Israelis don\'t see why they should keep taking the same risks when each time they do they are rewarded not with peace but more war from a less advantageous position. ',

			'ockquote> why does asking questions get you downvoted on this sub?  I suggest you look further into Apartheid. The minority ruling over majority was important, but only one aspect of it.

			'Important: Keep in mind that when I say Arabs, Zionists, Jews, Palestinians, Israelis, etc. I\'m not talking about all of them all the time. For example, when I say that Muslims attacked Israelis, then it doesn\'t mean that all Muslims were involved. Just that from the Muslims some attacked some Israelis. edit: More important things: I did try to be as impartial with this as I could. However, after reading through it I did realize that some parts do not appear very impartial. Also keep in mind that I tend to talk more about less known things, while I\'m more prone to skip over well known parts. This means that I\'ll often talk in more detail about what Zionists/Israelis did, as quite frankly their propaganda in the West was very effective. edit: Jews were discriminated against around the whole world. It wasn\'t anything unique to Nazi Germany, in fact it existed well before Nazis and continued even after WW2. Zionists came to Palestine to make their own country. (edit: There were also Arab immigrants coming Palestine. The "Palestine" I\'m talking about is the geographical location.) Before that movement started the Ottoman Empire also ramped up the registration of land ownership. Before that few people had their own land even registered and even with this coming many didn\'t register their land except when it was needed. (For example when selling it) Sadly this process was frought with corruption, causing both Ottoman officials and some individual Palestinians to register land under their name that wasn\'t actually theirs. At first this wasn\'t really a big issue, but then the Zionists came with a lot of money. Some of them bought land, which resulted in native Palestinians suddenly losing all their land and the Zionists drove them out. Causing them to live in caves. This obviously caused hate to accumulate between the groups, especially between Muslims and Zionists. The native Jews were also driven into the conflict, as some Muslims didn\'t differentiate between them. This caused both sides to mount attacks on each other. There were, for example, reports of Zionists bragging about how they beat up Palestinians. And the conflict grew worse over time, causing blood to spill at some point as more and more Zionists arrived. (edit: To clarify, while I did talk more about Zionists attacking Palestinians, as far as I know, most of the attacks were done by Muslims against Jews. I did talk more about Zionists, especially the ones that were unprovoked, because they were less know.) The owner of that land wasn\'t really important, so I won\'t get into to much detail of that. At first it was the Ottoman Empire, then Britain. Britain had enough of it and let the UN deal with it. Then came the UN partition plan. Well... The plan was largely supported by Zionists. US was supporting the Zionist movement and putting pressure on other countries to support the UN partition plan. Zionists also threatened and bribed other countries, which was quite easy sometimes considering that many were in need of loans after the big war. Obviously the Muslim natives wouldn\'t agree to losing more than half their land. Zionists declared independence, creating Israel. And the Muslims declared war. However, the Muslims were much worse equipeed than the Israelis, resulting in the loss in the war. Both sides comitted massacres during the war, but the Muslim side was worse in it. Many Muslims fled their homes during the war, since they didn\'t want to get killed. After the war ended the Muslims that fled their homes weren\'t allowed to return home and Israel confiscated their homes and gave them to Israelis. This created the so called "Palestinian refugees". I\'m not that knowledgeable about what happened next, so I\'ll just skip to the recent to now situation. After the wars Israel now occupies West Bank and Gaza is fully under Palestinian control. In West Bank the Palestinian party Fatah is in power, while in Gaza it\'s Hamas. West Bank is split into 3 zones. Area A, B and C. Area C is the biggest, being 61% of West Bank. Area C is being controlled by Israel. They get to decide who gets building permits. And sadly, the Palestinians find it pretty much impossible to get any building permits. This is why you often read about how classrooms, etc. get demolished by Israel, because they can\'t legally build them. They can\'t even renovate them without a permit. Water is also being supplied by Israel. The Water is being pumped out in occupied territory, and currently the Palestinian farmer barely get anything. This obviously caused agriculture to fall sharply. I think it fell by like 40% or sth like that when Israel changed policies. Israel itself also started to build settlements in Area C. Here are also 2 different types, once that are build where nothing was before, and others that are build on Palestinian land. Both are build in good locations, for example, in Jordan Valley are many settlements focusing on agriculture. The ones which are build on Palestinian land are pretty much the only ones that have a chance to get demolished, however this happens quite rarely. Recently there were even Palestinians that were forced to sell their land on which an illegal settlement was build. But these settlements being in good locations isn\'t the only issue. They need security, which is the Israeli military. This obviously also means that Palestinians aren\'t allowed to get too close to it, which causes the closure of nearby roads. For example, a road between 2 villages may get closed, forcing Palestinians to drive around it to arrive at their target. Lastly, there are also many important roads that go over long distances through West Bank. These roads are Israeli only, and Palestinians may only be allowed to drive through them with a special permit. A strong economy requires good ways to travel, due to this policy the economy in West Bank has serious issues. Area B is jointly controlled by Israel and PA. Area A is controlled by PA. However, Israel is the one collecting taxes, so they can put huge pressure on PA. Israel is also known to let PA pay extorbitant punishment fees for certain events. (Which they will take from the taxes themselves) They also regularily withhold taxes, for example they withheld the taxes when PA tried for its statehood to be recognized internationally. I\'m not too knowledgeable about Gaza either, so I won\'t talk about it so that I won\'t mention any mistakes. Coninued below...',
			'Now then this is the current situation. As for peace talks, I\'ll talk about this now: Don\'t trust the media. This is the most important point here sadly. There weren\'t "many opportunities Palestinians missed" like some people may proclaim. In fact, as far as I know, there were only a few times where they were moving well towards peace. The first time was probably during the creationg of the Oslo Accords. The ones that are often proclaimed as a failure, which they are. However, they\'re a failure because they\'re permanent. They were meant as a temporary measure to slowly give power to Palestinians and end in the creation of a Palestinian state. Sadly, the talks ended after the Israeli side was assassinated by an Israeli ultranationalist. The second time was Camp David and Taba Summit. Camp David failed because of a failure in basics of negotiations by Israel and the US. Israel really wanted peace and they blindly concentrated on this peace process, ignoring everything else. This included violating several agreements that they had with Palestinians. Palestinans obviously weren\'t happy with that and Israel wasn\'t able to get the message that they wanted peace to them. Instead Palestinians though that these peace talks would be a trap. They went to the US side and expressed their doubt and finally agreed to peace talks after getting a few agreements first. One of them was that there won\'t be any finger pointing. However, they only agreed to go to the talks, the trust issues still existed against both Israel and the US. Thinking it was a trap they didn\'t agree to anything and got their trust issues confirmed after the president that just promised them no finger pointing instantly started finger pointing. Yet this failure is still being blamed on the Palestinians in the media, which is why I said to not trust the media. Taba Summit was pretty much the continuation of Camp David. They were really close to an agreement there, and many main points were pretty much finished already. However, time ran out and there was a leadership change in Israel. The talks ended then. (Peace talks between Israel and Syria, which ended in failure, Camp David and the intifada cost too much time, thus these talks started way too late) Lastly were the Olmert talks and I\'ll be hones here, I\'m not too sure what to think about them either. Olmert was at the end of his career and people asked for him to resign (what he did shortly after the talks). Thus his political position was unstable and Palestinians had trust issues on whether the new leadership will follow the agreement. Officials on the US/Israel side also recommended the Palestinians to wait for a leader change in Israel and the US and not sign anything now. All of these probably contributed to why Palestinians didn\'t sign this agreement. This may have been a missed opportunity by Palestinians. Another important point is that peace talks currently are impossible. Recent peace talks had been between Fatah and Israel, as Hamas doesn\'t believe in peace talks. However, Israel has set requirements for peace talks that pretty much ask for the surrender of Hamas for there to be peace talks. Since this will never happen it means that unless Israel changes their requirements that there will be no peace talks. Fatah themselves also appear to not want direct talks with Israel as their past experiences showed that they\'ll just be painted black even if it\'s not their fault and because they don\'t believe Israel truly wants peace. It\'s also quite obvious that both the Palestinian and the Israeli leadership gain from the conflict. What else can give you support as easy as showing your citizen an enemy infront of them? The Palestinians fear that all their land will get stolen by Israelis, while the Israelis fear that they\'ll get murdered by Palestinians. On another note, if there is a serious peace process in the future, then without a doubt the biggest issue (other than trust) that it\'ll face are all those Israeli settlements in West Bank. There are many of them and many of them are in good land. So not only would Israel be unable to keep all of them (because a Palestinian state can\'t be completly fragmented, it would be impossible to manage), they would also have to exchange those that they do want to keep with land of equal value, which would be very difficult. Not to mention that the definition of the territory is different for each side. Israel says Israel annexed part of it in a war, while Palestinians say that it\'s still theirs, resulting in disputed territory. This is especially complicated for Palestinians because they think of Israel as already a compromise on the territory side. "They took already more than half of our land and now they want even more?" And while we\'re talking about territory, another reason that Palestinians aren\'t into direct talks with Israel currently is that they think Israel is only biding their time. They think Israel is continuing to increase settlement expansion to increase their leverage in a possible future peace agreement and to annex more land of West Bank. This obviously creates trust issues in whether Israel is truly looking for peace. This is why Fatah also appears to try to go use international processes to get to a peace agreement. Israel on the other hand is trying to stop that from happening. (An example of how they try to stop it would be how they withheld taxes when Palestine applied for statehood, as this was part of the process) They\'re currently trying to go through France, but I\'m also not too well informed in this, so I won\'t go into any details. Then there are terror attacks. They can be pretty much split into 2 groups: Organized and Lone wolf. Organized are attacks by Hamas and other terror groups that are operating in West Bank and Gaza. They are for example attacks via tunnels from Gaza (although, as far as I know, all of the recent ones were stopped before they happened), murder of Jews (like what the recent Gaza war triggered) and car bombings. The lone wolf attacks happen a lot in West Bank against Israeli settler. There are also terror attacks by Israelis, though those are way lower in number. The attacks by Israelis are often against property by settler in West Bank, like the burning down of a Palestinian orchard. TL;DR: It\'s fucked up. I hope I covered everything and didn\'t forget anything.',
			'Yea, because fuck kids trying to educate themselves in EU funded schools because they live in an area where the occupying government, probably illegally has a discriminatory building permit policy and probably illegally not only doesn\'t provide education for civilians in the land it\'s militarily occupying, but tears down schools for natives of the land they\'re occupying. Say this was poland, and there was a jewish camp, and the germans occupying poland refused to grant the jewish camp permits to build schools for their children. Say the EU funded the construction of schools for the children anyway, including, for instance, solar panels for the schools, because the destruction of poland has left this area without access to the power grid and the occupying germans have prevented them from building electrical infrastructure to connect to the grid. Then the german military comes in, destroys the schools for the jewish kids. Steals the solar panels.

This impedes the development of adequate housing, infrastructure and livelihoods in Palestinian communities, and has significant consequences for the entire West Bank population. Structures built without permits are regularly served with demolition orders, creating chronic uncertainty and threat, and encouraging people to leave. Where the orders are implemented, they have resulted in displacement and disruption of livelihoods, the entrenchment of poverty and increased aid dependency. The humanitarian community has faced a range of difficulties in providing aid in Area C, including the demolition and confiscation of assistance by the Israeli authorities" source: https://www.ochaopt.org/location/area-c  Area C is most of the west Bank. and it is not a single block. it goes and loops arrond the other areas splitting them into little pieces. see this map to understand: http://archive.peacenow.org/map.php',

			'I honestly don\'t believe that there will be any kind of compromise or two state solution. Even from the start the majority of Palestinians were in favor of some kind of reasonable compromise once they realized there was nothing they could do to stop what was happening and that the massacres/forced relocations and village destruction wasn\'t going to stop. Even now they have offered to agree to terms that overwhelmingly favor Israel. That said there was/is hardliners who refuse any solution except total Israeli withdrawal and do so with violence. But considering the subhuman treatment and war crimes steadily committed it\'s no surprise. I can\'t help but draw parallels with manifest destiny and the native Americans. In the sense that a population arrived with Devine authority who placed the natives on tiny parcels of land with next to no method of sustaining themselves. All the while deamonizing them and putting the blame squarely on them by holding up examples of attacks and terrorism that were generally feeble attempts at self defense or out of desperation due to starvation. And as in the case of Israel/Palestine the native Americans were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned never standing a real chance resulting in massacres which they ended up blamed for. The future outcome of which being what Israel is most likely enacting now. Just wait them out, keep building and maintaining the party line that they have been fair and generous and are willing to come to a solution but these subhuman terrorists won\'t have it and would kill them all given the chance. Justifying total subjugation in the name of self defense, and in 50-100 years there would be no possible way to find a solution as is the case in north America. We will look back and say it was wrong and handled differently but the results remain the same the invading culture is so deeply engrained and the native one now entirely dependent on it. now a few generations down they are just desperately trying to hang on to their cultural identity. Nevermind their own autonomously functional state. Israel will likely do the same, just keep finding ways to kill time and not allow Palestine the ability or chance to gain any ability of an effective response or allow global opinion to be at all sympathetic to Palestine or at best conflicted on the matter. At the same time provoking them into violence out of desperation so they can be held responsible for the situation. Until the day comes where it\'s all to far gone and we\'ll be looking back with 20/20 hindsight seeing it for what it was but saying its horrible but there\'s nothing to be done now. It\'s sickening the horrible human rights abuses and war crimes Israel has done internally and to the entire region while exploiting the dead of the Holocaust not only for justifying atrocities as self defense but as a means of denying any semblance of real debate or criticism. If it were any other state/group behaving in such a manner and the victims weren\'t Muslim the global community would be responding with intervention and war crimes charges as it did with the African civil wars and ethnic cleansings of the 80s and 90s.',

However, international law a) doesn\'t intend occupations to be permanent and b) doesn\'t allow you to build settlements on occupied land. In some ways, it seems like the current government of Israel wants to have it both ways--the West Bank belongs to Israel for the purpose of settlement, but is occupied for the purpose of voting.

Try reading the Zionist reaction to this proposed Palestinian state, including this part:  On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations following reports that the British were proposing to allow Palestine independence on the same terms as Iraq, a coordinated Irgun bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.

From jailing an opposing senator, going after media criticizing him, and likening himself to Hitler And you need to have less biased source than your wife. I assume both of you are not living in this country. If that\'s the case then you should know that most overseas Filipinos do in fact like Duterte. But that\'s like Turks in Europe liking Erdogan since they\'re not living in Turkey anyway and doesn\'t have direct experience living in his government.',

Cause thats what he essentially has. He is life and death in NK. He can raise you and your family into a life where you have pretty much everything you want one day, execute half of them the other day and send the rest to a concentration camp. Hell, when his daddy got bored one day and thought North Korean films are lacking, he had an actress and director from South Korea abducted and forced them to make NK propaganda movies. He owns these people. Where will a billion buy him the lifes of ~25 million people, an entire nation as personal playground, and the luxury he has now?',

Our money has value because it is backed by the economic output of it\'s area. $1 has value because it represents work that produces food, cars, services and whatever is required to keep a society running. Bo food is being produced by mining bitcoin... In fact the argument could be made that the massive amount of energy required for mining is bad for the economic output of a society. Cryptos are the perpetual motion machines of economy. And it seems people are figuring out that this just doesn\'t work.',
			'It does have some intrinsic value, in that the electricity produces a number that has certain properties that make it secure to some degree. This intrinsic value likely doesnt account for a majority of its value however. It\'s the extrinsic value that makes this up. There would be people who would pay a premium to be able to store their money in a distributed environment. Or to store their money by more secure means. I think this is what the real value of cryptocurrency will be. With this view though, you can see how inflated Bitcoin is - it essentially got picked up by the mass market because it was popular, rather than necessarily for its extrinsic value. Furthermore, if the extrinsic value is the major contributor, it\'ll be devalued by the introduction of other cryptocurrencies, especially if they provide a more cost effective way to achieve the intrinsic value. In the short term, governments will regulate, potentially putting a cap on its adoption and usefulness as a global currency, but long term it likely has its place.',

Total misunderstanding.  $1 has value because it represents work that produces food, cars, services and whatever is required to keep a society running.  BTC could just as easily represent those things.  Bo food is being produced by mining bitcoin...  No food is produced by making a dollar....  Cryptos are the perpetual motion machines of economy.  Literally quite the opposite, there is a finite amount of them. The dollars we keep printing by indebting future generations are much more akin to a perpetual motion machine that will eventually stop moving. BTC is no different to trading in gold (which was done for a long time) except it\'s faster, cheaper and can be done online. I\'m not saying I\'m an expert and I\'m not saying BTC will succeed but it\'s amazing to me how so many people like you will simultaneously say BTC is a guaranteed failure while demonstrating limited/no knowledge of economics, yet there are genuine economic experts out there who believe BTC can be viable. Be honest, do you genuinely believe you are knowledgeable enough on this subject to state unequivocally that BTC is non-viable?',

The dollar is not backed by the gold standard anymore and the US government prints money when it wants to; the process of printing that money also results in energy expenditure. Your dollar bills are a currency used to exchange one resource for another, so is cryptocurrency so I don\'t quite see the difference.  I agree that expenditure of huge amounts of energy on crypto transactions is wasteful, which is a reason why certain cryptocurrencies are moving towards proof of stake instead of proof of work systems.  My personal and somewhat bigger concerns around cryptocurrency are related to it being able to support transaction rates per second that are equivalent to those of larger credit card vendors (i.e. less than ten per second vs. thousands per second) Edit: Spacing/grammar',
