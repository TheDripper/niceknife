			'Wow, Europe is absolutely dominating these rankings.',
			'It’s a bit easier to be an international tourist in Europe, you’ve less far to go before you’ve travelled internationally than in, for example, the US, Canada, Australia etc.  When you think of developed countries where there are going to be a sizeable amount of people taking holidays, Europe is probably the easiest place to take those holidays internationally.

			'I just drove over the Rhine from Germany into France (and back again) two weeks ago. As an American it’s amazing to me that maybe the most hotly contested national border in the history of the world that has been the subject of 3 massive wars in the past century and a half is now less notable than crossing from North Carolina into South Carolina on i-95.  Meanwhile in the “land of the free” we are now requiring passports to get to/from CANADA and are about to build a wall in the freaking desert bc, you know, the desert apparently isn’t good enough to separate us from Mexico. ‘Murica!

			'that probably has a lot to do with the fact that most of the tourists to France and Spain are from neighboring countries, or close to it, that are spending short periods of time.

Thankfully we\'re getting better at English, albeit slow.',
			'Ahah I\'m Portuguese and I went to Barcelona last year, as expected they couldn\'t understand Portuguese in the slightest, so we had to use english most of the time, we could understand nearly any Spanish they used, but talking Spanish was a no no for me, I didn\'t want to embarrass myself that much. So yeah weird vacation, using a Germanic language when both of us spoke romance languages. ',
			'So weird, a lot of argentinians (including me) can speak spanish and understand portuguese (more or less) when going to brazil',
			'Idk maybe its our accent that makes it hard for them, a lot of ppl when earing european portuguese for the 1st time think its Russian ahahh',
			'Middle range Spanish wine is great value. Get something in the 8+ euro range, it\'s well worth it. The high end stuff is great as well, but if you\'re not an expert I don\'t think it\'s worth it. Stuff selling for 12 euro or so matches the stuff sold for 70+ pounds in the UK. ',
			'Brits form a large percentage of Spain\'s international tourism industry. Places like Benidorm and Ibiza have pretty much become tailored to a British demographic.',
			'Same thing with the Canary Islands.',
			'I think the added checking of phones and general shit that has to go on to get into the u.s is a big turn off. ',
			'Is the checking of phones actually happening? I remember reading about them considering it a year ago, but I\'ve had several people I know visit the US in the last year, and they haven\'t had their phones checked at all.',
			'I just spent a month there and didn\'t get my phone or laptop checked. Maybe it happens, but I guess it\'s only selectively. The TSA was pretty hit and miss actually, sometimes they wanted you to take your jumper off, sometimes not. Sometimes I had to take my camera out of my bag, sometimes not. Etc.',
			'Doesn\'t really matters if it does. Tourist safety is about possibilities. It\'s highly unlikely a local protest will even be noticed by a tourist, but it creates uncertainty. Same with travelling to the Arabian Peninsula or SE Asia and the possibility of a bagel poppy seed or a trace of marijuana on your clothes landing you in jail. Since there are other options, why take the risk?',
			'Yes they are. https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/06/us-border-guard-electronics-searches/',
			'Seems to depend on where you are coming from. I traveled into the US and talked to a border agent for around 10 seconds before I was let in. Somewhat of a letdown ;)',

			'You must be hiding something /s',

			'The chance is on the order of 1/10000 per device - I wouldnt let it stop you',
			'Yeah traveling to the US is generally just annoying',
			'Spain\'s big advantage is Trump. Like it or not his administration is deterring travel to the US. I\'m Canadian, usually visit the states a hand full of times a year and have one major vacation there. Last year went to South & Central America instead. This year heading to Europe. Same story with lots of friends and family. ',
			'Am Canadian, still love America due to proximity, and I like the culture and environment.',
			'Yeah, as an Aussie who just came back from a month long holiday in America, I absolutely fell in love with the country. I’ll be back no matter who’s the president. I love the culture, I love the people. I had fun in red states, I had fun in blue states. I’m not going to let an Oompa Loompa president ruin that for me.',
			'A very healthy outlook. There\'s basically nothing he can do to ruin a vacation.',
			'I mean, a thermonuclear war would ruin my vacation.',
			'Child please! America would have the best nuclear holocaust!',
			'red and blue is hyped up by the media and, especially, reddit. just like every other country, 99% of people are just normal nice people. If anything, because Americans don\'t travel internationally as much, they just want to talk to you and hear what you have to say. if you visit reddit every day you\'d think Southerners are all in the KKK and do the Hitler salute for Trump when he\'s on TV, but it\'s just not the case. I\'m glad you enjoyed our country. ',
			'This is really cool to hear. Visiting Australia is very high on my list of places to go. I would want to do what you did with the US and make a very long stay out of it. Out of curiosity, did you have an opportunity to see NYC and, if so, how did it compare to other cities you\'ve visited around the world. I remember very vividly the first time I saw NYC from a distance and I was rather blown away. For folks that would like to see Australia, is there something that not so obvious that we should make an effort to see?',
			'I don\'t know if it\'s Trump or old policy but the border control in the US is stupid as hell. My best friends GF planned a vacation to New York with her family. When she arrived in the US, they took their phones and laptops, hold them in a room for hours and after they finished, they were sent back home.  I don\'t think people are fine with risking their whole trip and losing their money (wasted plane tickets, hotel paid in advance, fees, etc.) so they are crossing the US as a must visit place. It\'s a shame because I think it\'s a beautiful country and I would love to visit but I don\'t see it happening under current circumstances.',
			'the point about visiting usa is that your first point of contact is with cunts in an airport who live to fuck your day. once you get past them, i\'m sure everything will be fine, so long as you can avoid the police',
			'I know but I don\'t want to take my chance at being sent back. I live in Spain, why risk it and spend 600 euros on a plane ticket to a place that I don\'t even know if they\'re going to let me in?',
			'I didn\'t even know we were that high as an American. I thought we were more of a "we go to other places" than "people come to us"',
			'Loads of people come to tourist magnets like NYC, Vegas, and Hollywood ',
			'No one actually goes to Hollywood, there\'s like 2 things to do there, most tourists just spend time in the rest of LA.',
			'Canadian here. NYC, Vegas, national parks, skiing... we do all that shit. Your country is great. You should come visit us. It\'s nice up here too.',
			'Flying into Madrid is the cheapest plus you have ton of great places to visit in Spain and cheaper then the US to would be better for a traveller to go from Madrid to Barcelona verse NYC to Philly the most popular route in us is the pch ',
			'I fly to Santander in Spain every week, costs me between £10 and £50 return. Live there work in London. Cheaper to travel back and forth to Spain than to travel by British Transport to any affordable part of the South of England.',
			'They have the world\'s best ham. Duh.',
			'Can confirm, am in Spain now. It’s awesome ',
			'Try visiting Ávila and its Wall. It\'s pretty nice ;)',
			'Lugo has a better wall, its an almost completely intact Roman city wall described as the finest example of late Roman fortifications in western Europe, dating from the 3rd century.',
			'ockquote> Lugo  Hey wow that\'s incredible, right on my bucket list!',
			'I’m in Madrid. Any other recommendations? ',
			'What have you seen so far?',
			'Segovia, Toledo and Aranjuez',
			'Wow, I had no idea USA was #2. I figured top 10, but wow. So you’re saying we are still top 3!? Alright guys!!!  FWIW Spain is the top of my list of places to visit I’ve never been. ',
			'So this made me go looking at the tourism rankings on wikipedia and there\'s something I don\'t quite get.  In 2015 France got 82.6 million tourist arrivals, with the US getting 75.6 million. However, the US made far more in receipts: $205.4 billion vs France\'s $44.9 billion. Is this because tourists arrive in France, then travel around the rest of Europe, spending their money in other countries; as opposed to tourists visiting the US that stay there for the entire trip?',
			'Many people in the UK, Germany, etc, will go on a day or weekend trip to France, as we have cheap Eurotunnel crossings, the ferry from Dover, various short flights and train journeys in to France, etc. On the other hand, if you’re going to America on holiday, you’re usually going to either spend a week or more there. Even if you do go on a short trip, it’s probably to New York or Vegas, so you’re likely going to spend a lot or gamble, whereas if you go to France, you’re probably going to check out museums, hike, etc, which aren’t really expensive activities. You also get REALLY cheap coach holiday deals in England for day trips to Disneyland Paris, so that’s probably a lot of people right there.',
			'That makes sense - I didn\'t think about it from the super-short/day trip angle.',
			'Sounds like total days spent in a country is a more useful metric than number of trips then.',
			'Maybe because countries in Europe are smaller? It\'s easier from a German, an Italian, a Spanish, a British to go to France just for the week end. America only have two neighbor countries that could take a quick trip, and some Caribbean countries. If someone from South America or the other continents is thinking to go to USA, probably they want to spend more than a week there.',
			'Prices for electronics (especially Apple) are much cheaper than Europe. I\'m sure that applies to Canada and Mexico as well. There are some very expensive malls built around foreign tourism in the US. ',
			'Well, I certainly try to avoid visiting the US and I love the place. Every border control experience was worse to the previous one. I\'ve refused jobs over the requirement of having to visit the US for either training or giving talks.',
			'What are your experiences with US border control? I find them pretty easy to deal with- I think entering the EU is far more invasive. I’m sure we have different experiences so I’d like to hear how yours differs from mine. Edit- will you people responding please stop arguing with me? My experiences happened, if you don’t believe me then that isn’t my problem- I won’t try to convince you. And seriously, stop bending over backwards to attack the US or defend the EU- If your experiences differ from mine then that’s all you need to say. There is no need for tangential rants about American racism.',
			'I\'ve been retained and interviewed for no apparent reason, in one occasion I lost a connection because of it and I wasn\'t given any compensation for it. The border officials have been as rude as humanly possible to me and other visitors as well, their attitude has consistently been that you are annoying them by simply being there. Nowhere else I\'ve had similar experiences (except maybe Russia once, but not as consistently). I\'ve been to dozens of countries and the US has been by far the worst in this regard. It was fine in the 90s though. Probably the EU is just as bad with people coming from other countries, but I don\'t have this experience.',
			'In the US we hate the airport workers as well. They have way too much power and they all abuse it. They should either be reigned in or if they want to keep all that power it should be a much more important job where you really need a ton of training and maybe a college degree to do it. Like the FBI or something like that.',
			'As a US citizen who regularly flies in and out of the EU, I can tell you that security at EU airports is an absolute dream. Even as a citizen, US airport security, customs, and passport control officers are 50-50 dickheads. Weirdly, coming to the US from Canada seems to be the worst.',
			'Stop search is random and even as a white guy, I still get pulled aside occasionally. But if it does happen, It really sucks and eats away layover time. As for the security itself, they are super rude and boring and difficult to work with but it comes down to just an attitude thing. You don’t want to be there, they don’t. No reason to let it get to you. The missed connection is suuuuuper shit and I can see why that would ruin an experience.  Whenever I have to travel in the EU tho, an American passport makes it pretty tedious compared to anyone with an EU one. Lines are super long and usually have to detour. Which makes sense since I’m not a European, but I think there’s a level of understanding you’d need when visiting somewhere else ',
			'I was tested for bomb making material last time I was at the airport because I forgot some gum in my pocket. White guy too. =/',
			'My experiences with US border control as a European have mostly come down to extreme waiting times. I\'ve never been extensively checked or anything like that. One of my sisters had a strip search once though. I\'ve entered the US probably two dozen times through half a dozen airports over the years, and have regularly stood in line for 2 or 3 hours just to have my passport checked (I think the record was 6 hours once in SF), and the people who do it appear to be particularly unfriendly. I am a pretty well traveled person and have visited probably 30 -maybe 40- countries across the globe by airplane. The USA definitely ranks among the bottom 3. I\'ll pay significantly extra to layover anywhere else if going to the Americas outside of the USA. It would not be the first time I miss a connecting flight that I had 3 hours to get to.',
			'I\'m a white American and it\'s been less hassle for me to get into European countries than it has to get back into the US. I don\'t have any interesting stories but the lines are always crazy long, the people you have to talk to seem to hate their job and despise everyone, and they\'re really bad/slow at their job.',
			'Me arriving in Spain. Show passport, good day sir, collect bags and enter Me arriving in USA 60 minutes queuing, 10 minute grilling from a man who looks like he has hated me since birth. Enter states without any friendship shown.',
			'Airport security in the US is basically a jobs program for people that can\'t find work anywhere else. Pretty much the only reason that it exists imo. Most of those people aren\'t even trained in any kind of a law enforcement capacity. They\'re just randoms off the street same as any other job--except they have the authority to check your asshole for illegal firearms.',
			'They are clever those American border chaps. I always hide my 12 gauge shotgun up my arse.',
			'Sawn-off or full size?',
			'And now they check your phone. ',
			'I\'ve been detained and had my car searched every time I\'ve come back over the border from Canada, with the US Boarder Patrol being as big of assholes as humanly possible. Man I wish I had that much time on my hands.',
			'Its only getting worse. These people are now trying to make their jobs into heroic endeavors, like how a lot of Americans view cops. Give me a break. ',
			'ockquote> I think entering the EU is far more invasive.   Based on your comment history you are from the US, right? So when you go to the EU, you enter as a non-citizen. When you enter the US, you enter as a citizen. How do you think you can objectively compare those two? What are your experiences with EU border control that you think it is "far more invasive"? ',
			'He says the lines are long for Americans ',
			'Well, yeah. It goes both ways obviously. I can certainly compare my experiences entering the EU with a Europeans experience entering the US. Why couldn’t I?  I flew into Amsterdam one time to connect to a flight to Edinburgh. I was pulled out of line and taken to curtained off area with a guy who frisked me, put his hand on my crotch and then had me pull my underwear waistband away from my body so he could look into my pants. Another time in Paris I missed a connecting flight for a long, thorough examination of all of my luggage. Neither of which has happened to me when returning to the US. And obviously I am aware that there are differences if you are a citizen vs a non-citizen- but that goes for everyone. I just wanted to know what the experiences are for non-US citizens.',
			'With a Canadian passport, have flown to America, Asia and Europe on many occasions. America is more unpleasant in terms of security. I think you\'re getting some backlash for being American, I\'ve never experienced what you\'re saying.',
			'Well, I am a Canadian. The United State\'s closest ally. I am also, a white male, and an adult. No criminal record. I was wearing a dress shirt, and casual clothes. I went to the USA, to visit my sister. They wouldn\'t let me through. They phoned my sister; she is my sister, and I\'ve travelled to this same address four times over the last ten years to visit them. They gave me no reason for not letting me cross. Several years later: Dating someone in the USA. I go to visit them. The next year, I visit them again. Border security has no record that I left the country the previous year. Yes, their record must look like "he arrived. . . .he arrived again. . ?" It doesn\'t matter: I\'m arrested and deported for staying in the country too long. That I was once denied entry to the USA--again, for literally no reason--is initially brought up as evidence against me. "We denied you access before, so there\'s a good chance you really are a bad guy." Even today, months later, I\'m still fighting off a disease I got while locked up. It\'s getting better, and I should be fine soon, I hope. Compare to my experience in travelliing to Europe: when I immediately realized my language skills were not nearly as good as I thought, while I was talking to the border gaurd, and then having a laugh about it with them. Them letting me know things are okay; conduting an interview like usual, eventually, and things are okay.  In the two examples I gave with the USA border gaurds: if the entire time, I spoke only French, then I am sure we would not "just have a laugh about it." I might still be locked up today! That whole attitude that, as a person from the USA, you expect to even attain an impartial stance on the USA border system? We all want such introspection, but to have it for your own nation: Canada\'s border system will always appear great, to me. Because Canada will always be the greatest nation for me, a Canadian. How can I be impartial? Do you understand what I mean? [EDIT: I may have been too mean at first, so i fixed some typos and removed the unkind statements.] ',

			'Really? Every time I go to the EU there is no line, the passport guy just waves me through, and in the 25 or so time\'s I\'ve been I\'ve never had bags searched once.',
			'I\'d heard horror stories about US border control, but I thought they were mostly exaggerations and it wouldn\'t be so ridiculous. They were really grilling a family in front of me about some documentation or another, and I thought I was going to get the same treatment because I\'d had a bit of an ordeal with the automatic passport machines. Anyway I get to the front and the guy just waves me on through. He saw I looked slightly shocked and said, "what, you\'re from London, not Iran?". Oh yeah I\'m white and the family was brown.',

Sure, some PEOPLE in the US are asshats, not all of them, not even close but my god many parts of that country are absolutely stunning.  But it really comes down to where you are from too.

			'This is the problem with the modern news cycle. You need to wait until you have all the facts before you publish an article. Especially when it pertains to something this serious. ',
			'Crazy part to me was when the news broke it was a hoax, the local news station (toronto) had a headline posted "11yr old girl, 6th grade, attends such and such school." Wtf? She\'s a child, stop posting details on where to find her. ',
			'Ahh CP24. Gotta love their lack of journalistic skills. ',
			'I remember when there was a school stabbing, the first thing CP24 did was ask the teens right after school ended what kind of person the victim was, then they went to the apartment he lived in and asked the primary school kids about it. And right before that they asked his crying relatives for a statement. One of them who fainted when hearing the news. :) Fucking A. Edited because of my crappy grammar lmao.',
			'there was an accident that killed a kid from my high school and cp24 ended up coming to my high school the day after, started asking everybody questions about what type of kid he was and if he was in any gang activity and when we held a ceremony for the kid they tried asking everyone who the siblings were so they could interview them... let’s just say they had 400+ angry high school students throwing shit at them and chasing them off the property ',
			'That\'s so weird. He got killed in a car accident and they connected that to gangs? ',
			'i mean they didn’t make the connection they just asked if he was because an extendo and weed were found in the car ',
			'They are garbage ',
			'In case people are wondering just how garbage. Here is one of the classic garbage dump done by one of the knucklehead pundits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiJ-hLWoPQk',

			'CP24: breaking news. In other words, some shit that I over heard, and haved looked into the truth of it. I get what they are trying to do. But seriously, taking the time to verify all the facts and details is proper journalism.',
			'To be fair, her and her parents attended a news conference about it at her school. Holding a press conference to discuss allegations normally means you can be put on the record.',
			'This happened to a friend of mine. They were at a protest and ended up getting arrested and a shitty news station figured out they were a sex worker and posted her real name, her work alias and her fucking home address. So fucked up.  Edit: by home address I should specify it was her street address and intersection, but said something like "residing at a upscale condo building at x & y" of which there was only one option. It was enough to have alt right nutcases hanging around her area harassing her. Edit 2: No, not \'Moldylocks\'',
			'ockquote> They were at a protest and ended up getting arrested and a shitty news station figured out they were a sex worker and posted her real name  You’re friends with Moldylocks?',
			'Publishing half assed ones like this however make the most money.',
			'Was just about to say this. Why make a full article when you can make a half assed one that does well and a full proper coverage. Way more money',
			'I have a different opinion about this. I think yours leads to a censored, lethargic press. Toronto police searching for man who allegedly cut 11-year-old girl’s hijab is the first I heard of this story. They use the proper wording to ensure that a critical reader knows it\'s an alleged crime, that it is being investigated, that they are reporting what the girl said - not that it absolutely happened and we should all be outraged. If you wait for \'all the facts\' you could be waiting forever. News like this ought to be published (i.e. A breaking news story about an alleged hate crime), it\'s just a shame when it\'s an attempt to hoodwink the media with a hoax. That\'s why they will all gladly admit that it was a hoax and cover that fact as well. The press works because it disseminates information to the public in a timely manner. The public needs to be informed. When the media is wrong, makes a mistake, or publishes information that turns out to be false, they admit to it and inform the public of that too.',
			'And at least the media makes corrections, unlike social media, which is where stories are often breaking these days. Just take a look at any "reddit live" thread when there is a major event. They are typically nothing but unsubstantiated reports from twitter or other anonymous sources, with 10s of thousands of people clicking refresh. It seems a little ironic for people to use reddit, essentially a social media platform, to complain about amateur news reporting.',
			'"Entertainment news." This shit isn\'t real news. We don\'t have real news anymore. No one has standards of reporting because their aim is not to inform the world but disinform us–– to satisfy those who cut the checks. ',
			'I think it\'s referred to as "infotainment"',
			'I\'ve been saying this story is ridiculous and sounded like something that came out of a 11 year old\'s imagination. A grown man sneaks up to a little girl, carefully cuts her hijab with scissors without harming her in any other way, and returns 10 minutes later to do the same thing... yeah, sure.',
			'because it bothered him that he only cut one side, he couldn\'t let her walk around with an unsymetric hijab',
			'Asymmetric',
			'I know that they say the criminal always returns to the scene of the crime, and I don\'t want to fall into that, but... goddamn, I can\'t stop thinking about the lack of symmetry. What was I thinking? Two cuts, you idiot, two cuts! Symmetry must be maintained! No, no... you\'re just being neurotic again. We talked about this. You don\'t need to make two cuts. It\'s fine. Symmetry isn\'t that important. You don\'t NEED symmetry. You don\'t need symmetry. I NEED SYMMETRY! GODAMMIT, I NEED TO FIX THIS!!',
			'As soon as I heard her telling the story to the press I could tell she was making it up. The way she offered no detail and recited it like it was something she had to memorize instead of something that happened to her. I really hoped I was wrong, but then thought, "Wait, so now I want the kid to have been targeted for a hate crime?" This is just a sad story. I feel bad for the girl if she was coached to say this. She is 11 and there are people online who will say horrible things about her and try to ruin her life. It ends up being traumatic for her whether it happened or not. Kids tell lies, but usually it isn\'t an international news story.',
			'Also how enthusiastically she talked about how ‘traumatic’ it was. The last thing a kid with trauma like bullying would want is a fucking press conference to talk to strangers about the encounter. Manipulating kids into this shit is child abuse in itself.',
			'What gets me is that Toronto District School Board held a press conference for this. I don’t understand why the school board felt the need to get involved to this degree especially when the police weren’t done investigating. ',
			'Exactly. The whole thing sounded too perfectly played out to make the little girl look like a hero (while also pushing way too specific of a narrative) to be real. It\'s the type of thing a kid (or some incredibly moronic person) imagines where they can get attention from it and be a hero. I say this because I remember thinking things like this as a kid with issues relating to my heritage.  I remember when I first heard the story on the radio I turned to my mother and said it seemed way too fishy to be real.',
			'This is yet another example of how toxic 24-hour media coverage has become. There is little to no time given to prove or disprove an allegation before people begin going insane. Lives are being destroyed. It\'s the colosseum.  News = Entertainment = Revenue The news is not here to inform you, guys. It is here to make money off of you. It is no different than athletics, film, music, etc. The political madness/divisiveness - the war-centric rants - the celebrity culture - the back-and-forth "spin". It\'s all to make money. Nothing more. It\'s a show. Source: Have worked in media for years making money off of the public\'s short attention spans and hunger for hatred. Coincidentally, I stopped watching news coverage of ANY kind within a year or two of entering the industry. It\'s a ruse, and a horribly destructive one at that. ',
			'If only people understood this. The networks are making a killing trashing Trump - that\'s why they do it. Or if not a killing, they\'re making what they need to stay afloat by "pushing that narrative." And conversely, Fox makes money backing him up. The people screaming for objective journalism don\'t understand that there isn\'t any money in it, sadly. If CNN corners the market on anti-trump news, they aren\'t going to publish a groundbreaking pro-trump story. Why would they? That pushes away their source of income. Likewise, Fox isn\'t going to run a major anti-Trump story because it hurts theirs. I don\'t know what the answer is but the short-term one is to turn off the news - the polarization rn is astronomic. Your mental health and optimism will improve markedly when you no longer pay attention.',
			'Had a similar instance in my home town last year where a Muslim woman was beaten by 3 white men to the point of being hospitalized. Turned out her family did the beating, and everyone in the family held up the line.  I agree with a couple of things mentioned here: 1. This hurts people who are actual victims of hatecrimes. 2. It makes me take all reports of hatecrimes with a grain of salt, and I find them less believeable.  Edit: incident happend in 2017, corrected my statement.  Edit 2: Here is the story for the curious Edit 3: I\'m a local, and live close to the neighborhood this happened in. This was the result of a brawl involving this woman, her family, and neighbors. The woman was on the bottom of the pile. My initial comment was made based on my recollection of the story at the time and with conversations with other locals. Either way, she and her family made this a hate crime issue through social and local media, and at one point in time a Gofundme with donations totalling around $80k based on that premise. Columbus is a very forward city, and the collective reaction was that we were all pretty appalled.  Edit 4: The fundraiser was on LaunchGood. Not Gofundme, and raised over $100,00.00',

There are massive faults on the right, but they can’t be solved by just bashing everyone’s characters.  If you want to argue that voting against Trump or some GOP member is the best decision, by all means, provide factual reasons for doing so — do not just call someone a bigot for disagreeing with your perspective.  In honor of MLK, I hope we all can hear these words ring true:   I have a dream that one day little black boys and girls will be holding hands with little white boys and girls. Now, I say to you today my friends, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: - \'We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.  We need to see each other as equals, and not close our ears when someone speaks out, or force their mouths closed when they disagree. We are all one in the same, and our opinions should be heard equally. To deal with the bigot, you show the bigot that their perspective is wrong; simply telling them doesn’t do anything but reinforce the opposing opinions. ',
			'Tbh, if Trump gets to the end of his 4 years without getting impeached he is almost certain to win the next election. Literally anything he does can be undermined because he\'s a \'Russian puppet\', so either he gets impeached or it looks like such a massive hit piece on him that his support will get even greater. The Russia investigation may well be the worst thing to happen, because his opponents aren\'t critically analysing his presidency, they\'re waiting for him to go.',

			'Folks don\'t want to believe it, but right now he\'ll slam dunk the 2020 election. We have the same people who lied to the public through the election cycle, continuing to lie, blow smoke and attack the right. If i had a tinfoil beanie i\'d say someone\'s strongly invested in a civil war in america.  But i don\'t. So i\'m not.',

			'As a Muslim this kinda pisses me off. I obviously do not know the circumstance of the situation, but Canada is full of respectful people, and I never lose hope in thinking they are.  But if this isn\'t true why would u make shit up like that. Totally disrespectful. You waste Police time, and communities time because they rally behind you and it turns out it was a hoax? What if this happened for real next time. Seriously SMH at some people. I hope this young girl learns from this experience, never cry wolf.',

She probably didn\'t want to wear the hijab and was caught. But before the ink on the report is dry, news trucks are parked outside of the school, our PM is virtue signaling and the usual parts of the internet and Reddit are up in arms.

So far that there we are now experiencing the desperate and last dying breaths of industries and politicians to get the last little bits they can before the future finally closes the door on them. ',

Would we poison our water to the point that we\'d never be able to drink from a stream until we\'ve filtered and purified the hell out of it? Would we poison the land to the point that we wouldn\'t be able to walk on it without hazmat suits? I see an article like this and wonder.',
			'Something I find interesting is why we choose to try to colonise Mars when Venus would be so much easyer to get to. I feel if we change our goal to populate our twin then billions of research money can be invested into cleaning up the atmosphere.  As it stands with what we know now it\'s easier to change Mars (pollution) than it is to change Venus (cleaning) Perhaps this should tell you somthing about our chances of survival as a race',
			'Venus isn\'t just about \'cleaning\' though, unless I\'m mistaken Venus has so much Co2 that it would coat the ground to a not insignificant depth were we to find a way to displace it from the atmosphere. So we\'d have to lock it up somehow, and remove it from the planet surface. Imagine trying to clean a meter of snow from every inch of the planet; and the snow never melts. Where do you put it?',
			'That\'s kinda the point. If we can learn how to there we can do it here',
			'Even here it\'s a "Where do you out it" problem. You either dump it under ground, or make it into blocks which just...you still have the base total amount of Co2. The only way around it it to convert PURE carbon to something else; I suppose energy but I don\'t know how much energy Carbon has or...how that\'d even work. Even then you have more Carbon than all the Coal/oil/gas deposits on earth by orders of magnitude. ',
			'Carbon is a solid right? We could press it into blocks? We\'ll build a wall and make Venus\' atmosphere pay for it.  Seriously though, we could use it to build structures and then coat them to keep the carbon from chipping off.',
			'Uh, it’s CO2 witch is a gas at normal temp if we could separate try two that would be problem solved there as we would have a ton of oxygen and done, also carbon is an element not a solid, when speaking in elements it’s important to remember that they can change state. Also the surface temp of Venus is 462 C',
			'Problem is right now it costs more energy to \'scrub\' our atmosphere than to put the green house gas there in the first place. This is why solar wind nuke etc is the best option. You get a double effect. Stop putting the gas there in the first place and have energy to clean that\'s not dirty to start with. Still got the problem of what to do when you get it out the air but it\'s a good start. I personally like the idea of making a lifeform that is a supper scrubber. But with every idea there are risks. We don\'t want triffids',
			'dude, is there any way we can use this Co2 snow as a building material?',
			'It wouldn\'t even make a dent likely, it\'s an insane amount of Co2. There were old terraforming ideas for Venus because we thought the atmosphere was comparable to ours densitywise...just Co2 filled. It\'s MANY times denser than ours though, like 100x or something. Even if you magically transplanted 7 billion people there and used the captured Co2 in every building, there\'d still be too much. I\'m on my phone or I\'d cite sources but I think the calcs are on Wikipedia\'s site under Venus terraforming. ',
			'Couldn’t we just throw some grass down and get that to suck up some CO2?',
			'Mars has virtually no atmosphere, less than 1% of Earth.',
			'Venus has no water either on ground or in its atmosphere (20ppm vapour). Ground level pressure is 15 times higher than earth, 96% of atmosphere is CO2, rest is nitrogen, no metals found in its crest so all metals need to be sent via rockets. 900F ground temp all over the planet all around the year.  What is your plan for cleaning this?',
			'No plan I\'m just a man. But I feel it\'s more worth investing in tech that can clean rather than tech that can add to the atmosphere. For our current needs',
			'One will be a multi billionaire if one finds an economical way of reducing the atmospheric CO2 on earth from 400ppm to 300ppm.  sometimes cleaning is harder than adding.. We have all the resources here on earth that you may need without moving it millions of miles from other planet.',
			'Perhaps I should explain. I don\'t mean to go to Venus. But to learn from the ideas of what we could do to terriform such a place',
			'Honestly, the concept of building a city that floats on top of the higher pressure atmosphere isn\'t that crazy. You\'ll still have to deal with all the corrosion issues, however.',
			'ockquote> You\'ll still have to deal with all the corrosion issues, however.  yeah, sulfuric acid clouds are not fun..',
			'It also has to do with proximity to the sun. Venus catches a lot more rays than mars, because it\'s much closer to the sun. So, you\'d have to clean it up, and have some sort of upper atmosphere ozone/gas shield, to keep the surface shielded. And I think this problem solves itself. Humans have stopped evolving. Tech has nearly surpassed us. Certainly some new organisms will be created in the coming decades, that are combinations of silicon, and carbon life will exist.  It seems crazy now. But, it happens gradually. First it\'s Military Computers. Then it\'s PCs. Then it\'s Laptops. Then it\'s Smartphones. Then it\'s tech that interacts with biology(fit bit, etc). Then it\'s tech INTEGRATED with biology. And the line blurs further, and further. I think we\'ll be creating the species that wipes us out, fairly soon. ',
			'To become a type 1 species it\'s quite posible that it will be easier to be silicon life form but not required but to be type 2 and reach other stars, if warp drive is not viable then it\'s almost required.',
			'Hell, maybe the whole theory on classifying civilizations that way doesn\'t mean diddly squat. After all, we\'re cavemen, theorizing about things we don\'t understand, in the slightest, except by our own, inaccurate, simplified constructs. FIRE BURN. GRAVITY MOVES. AMEN.',
			'Oook missed the /s I think.',
			'I don\'t think it would be required, but sure it\'d be a plus. The basic Kardashev scale doesn\'t make any recommendations about that as far as I know, as it\'s based on the ability to harness energy (planetary > solar > galactic), and sites like futuretimeline.net don\'t suggest it would be a requirement for interstellar travel. They do suggest it will become the norm to be augmented in some way, long before we even reach Type 1, let alone get any farther up the scale. Humans as we know them will be a dying species at that point.',
			'Personally I think we need to move on rather than be stagnant. A self (human) made evolution is a good thing. I hope things like upgrading my memory with chips etc becomes a thing in our lifetime...I think what holds us back more than anything is the social stigma as in many ways tech is ready do change us now but it\'s not seen as ok in a social way.',

			'I think the environment would be fucked well before the air toxicity was high enough that you\'ll need to wear a mask/carry an oxygen tank. Especially in counties that don\'t produce so much pollution. If that many toxins/greenhouse gases were in the air the weather would be really fucked up too, farming would get a lot harder, a lot more "natural" disasters.',
			'Huh, this is basically a solar updraft tower, which are usually talked about in terms of producing electricity. It creates a constant supply of wind through updraft you then put wind turbines in the tower and you don\'t have to worry about the output variability of standard wind turbines.',
			'So, theoretically, we could solve global warming, and supply power to the entire globe?',
			'The only image is that of an artist\'s impression and a half built tower. I would take this news with a big help of salt since it lacks actual data, pictures or numbers. The article only has anecdotal stories (one person said he felt the air was clean and so on).  Don\'t get me wrong.

(I\'m a bot)   An experimental tower over 100 metres high in northern China - dubbed the world\'s biggest air purifier by its operators - has brought a noticeable improvement in air quality, according to the scientist leading the project, as authorities seek ways to tackle the nation\'s chronic smog problem. The head of the research, Cao Junji, said improvements in air quality had been observed over an area of 10 square kilometres in the city over the past few months and the tower has managed to produce more than 10 million cubic metres of clean air a day since its launch. From ionising towers to bicycles, Dutchman\'s smog-removing inventions stand to clear the air in polluted China.

But environmental protection would cut into those sweet sweet profits and hence, lower stock prices. Disposal of toxic waste require special transport or systems that owners aren\'t willing to pay.

			'A factor in the smog is due to it\'s location to the gobi desert and it being in a valley.  "Beijing\'s smog woes are compounded by an accident of geography, according to AccuWeather.

Now I\'m an expat in the South and this year my doctor back home asked me to stop my position in China. I lost 12% long capacity due to pollution over a span of 6 years (2 assignments).

Back in the 90s, walking outside meant your face would be blackened and few people wore white because it meant your clothes were going to get ruined.  Beijing\'s non smog days have drastically increased and even the ccp can\'t command the smog to leave. That\'s visible change, something you literally can\'t fudge.

And of course bed bugs are but one of many potential vectors that air travelers should be concerned with, including body lice and others. Almost all commercial aircraft cabins (and many cargo holds) are virtually air-tight of necessity, as this allows them to be pressurized for high altitude flight.

Frankly, there\'s little concern that Britain isn\'t already great among Brexit supporters, which is why we\'ve got the confidence in our nation to believe that we can go it alone outside the EU. Among other reasons, Brexit came about because the UK ceded control over immigration controls on EU citizens. There are now no immigration controls between members of the European Union, which over the last 15 years has expanded to include very poor countries in Eastern Europe where wages and living standards are just a fraction of that found in the UK. Over the last 15 years, millions of Eastern Europeans have migrated to the UK.  This abundance of cheap labour has suppressed British wages and disproportionately affected the working-class as they\'ve been displaced from traditional jobs in retail, manual labour and manufacturing. Eastern European workers are quite often taken advantage of by their bosses to undercut British workers. As for British products, the UK is the 8th largest exporter in the world so you\'ve more than likely made use of British products without realising it. The UK doesn\'t make low-grade household goods, but rather pharmaceuticals, aerospace goods, machinery, automobiles, refined minerals and petroleum.

In fact, even more recently my great grandfather shoveled coal all his life and because of it died of lung cancer at an early age, but because of him I get to live a life of luxury today. I know of family members who died fighting in WW2 to keep democracy alive when the UK was the only country that opposed Hitler. They worked and fought to create a better Britain for their family, countrymen, culture, society and ideals. Why would I want other people benefiting from their legacy? Look at Africa. Today as a continent it is home to hundreds of millions of middle class Africans. They have the means to help and uplift their fellow Africans, yet they chose to live in gated communities away from their own people. The world\'s poor can\'t come to live in the rich west, they\'re simply not our problem.',

Among younger voters the majority is even larger, with 73% of 18-34 year-olds now backing a second vote.

		title: 'Russian Billionaire Files Fraud Lawsuit Against Manafort, Cites Mueller Docs ',
		ments: [
			'So a little more information on Russian oligarch Deripaska and Paul Manafort.  Paul Manafort was brought into the Trump campaign as chairman and he made one specific change to the GOP platform during the convention - to rescind support for Ukraine.[1] He has since been indicted by Special Counsel Mueller.[2] We know Paul Manafort offered to give a Russian billionaire private briefings on the campaign trail, the oligarch was Oleg Deripaska.[3] Paul Manafort used a campaign account for the aforementioned email correspondence.[4] Now you might be wondering who Oleg Deripaska and Dimitry Firtash are and how they are connected Manafort. One of them is a Russian oligarch who has close ties to the Kremlin and Putin. The other is a Ukrainian oligarch who is wanted by the Justice Department so he can stand trail for a 2013 racketeering indictment. Manafort partnered with them over a massive real-estate deal.[5] Now this is where it becomes interesting. Back in 2006 Paul Manafort offered a deal to Russian oligarch Deripaska where he indicated he would offer a great service in pushing Putin\'s policies abroad. He was paid very handsomely by Deripaska.[6]  Manafort pitched the plans to aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, a close Putin ally with whom Manafort eventually signed a $10 million annual contract beginning in 2006, according to interviews with several people familiar with payments to Manafort and business records obtained by the AP. Manafort and Deripaska maintained a business relationship until at least 2009, according to one person familiar with the work. “We are now of the belief that this model can greatly benefit the Putin Government if employed at the correct levels with the appropriate commitment to success,” Manafort wrote in the 2005 memo to Deripaska. The effort, Manafort wrote, “will be offering a great service that can re-focus, both internally and externally, the policies of the Putin government.”  In 2014 Deripaska sued Manafort for a cool $19 million claiming that Manafort and Gates had stolen funds intended for an investment.[7] The Associated Press were the first ones to discover their business dealings and Deripaska attempted and failed at suing the AP for libel.[8] What\'s even more peculiar is that Paul Manafort worked as Trump\'s campaign chairman for free.[9] Oh and in 2006 Manafort bought a condo in Trump Tower.[10] Paul Manafort was present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting where adoptions were discussed with Russian operatives.[11] Adoptions is an established euphemism used in reference to the Magnitsky Act, sanctions that are meant to cripple the power of Putin.[12]  Manafort\'s daughters\' phones were hacked and their texts were released almost a year ago. I think these texts paint a very clear picture under the context of what we now know about Paul Manafort, Trump, and Russia.[13] Senator Feinstein released a 300 page transcript of a testimony by Simpson and Fusion GPS that indicates Russia tried to use Oleg Deripaska and Paul Manafort to befriend GOP leadership around 2008. It alludes to the fact that the Russians knew they could befriend members of the GOP through oligarchs used as intermediaries almost a decade ago. Something we know they pursued and acted upon in the 2016 election. The testimony also clearly states that Manafort had been receiving intelligence from the Kremlin.This makes the Trump Tower meeting in 2016 with Russian operatives Natalia Veselnitskaya and Rinat Akhmetshin seem incredibly damning as we can extrapolate that the campaign most likely received foreign intelligence aid.[14]  1) NPR - 2016 RNC Delegate: Trump Directed Change To Party Platform On Ukraine Support 2) Politico - United States of America v. Paul J. Manafort, Jr. and Richard W. Gates III 3) Washington Post - Manafort offered to give Russian billionaire ‘private briefings’ on 2016 campaign 4) Politico - Manafort used Trump campaign account to email Ukrainian operative 5) The Daily Beast - Paul Manafort Sought $850 Million Deal With Putin Ally and Alleged Gangster 6) Associated Press - AP Exclusive: Before Trump job, Manafort worked to aid Putin 7) Washington Post - Manafort’s Russia connection: What you need to know about Oleg Deripaska 8) Politico - Judge tosses libel lawsuit against AP by Russian oligarch tied to Manafort 9) TIME - How Donald Trump Hired and Fired Paul Manafort 10) NBC - Ex-Trump Aide Manafort Bought New York Homes With Cash 11) New York Times - Talking Points Brought to Trump Tower Meeting Were Shared With Kremlin 12) The Atlantic - Why Does the Kremlin Care So Much About the Magnitsky Act?  13) Politico - Manafort’s Ukrainian ‘blood money’ caused qualms, hack suggests 14) Transcript of Senate Judiciary Committee Interview Glenn Simpson of GPS',
			'The pages of the transcript of Fusion GPS testimony I am referring to; Pg. 151 - 153  The only other thing I\'d add to all that is, again, in the mid 2000s one of the stories I wrote -- actually, I wrote a couple different stories about a Russian oligarch having a meeting with Senator John McCain shortly before the 2008 presidential election and another story or set of stories about Paul Manafort and his involvement with some Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs who were considered to be suspicious or corrupt. So I also knew -- or I formed an opinion or impression that the Russians were interested in making friends with the Republicans and that Paul Manafort, you know, there was this previous episode involving Paul Manafort, John McCain. So all of that was in my head when this came in which, as I say, tended to support the credibility -- the possibility that this information was credible. Q. You mentioned a Russian oligarch who had met with Senator McCain. Who specifically was that? A. Oleg Deripaska, O-L-E-G, D-E-R-I-P-A-S-K-A. He\'s not able to travel to the United States because he\'s banned for suspicion of ties to organized crime. He\'s extremely close to the Kremlin, or at least he was, and is -- I broke the story of him being banned from the United States which caused him a lot of embarrassment and trouble with his business and led to him hiring a lobbyist and trying to get involved with getting a visa to the U.S. Q. And you had also mentioned your background knowledge of Paul Manafort and his involvement with Russian oligarchs. Can you identify who those individuals were and the basis of that knowledge? A. The issue I specifically wrote about I believe was his work for the Party of Regions and Victor Yanukovych, Y-A-N-U-K-O-V-Y-C-H, I think, and that\'s the Pro-Russia party or was the Pro-Russia party in Ukraine, and all that work sort of grew out of work I had done about the Kremlin working with the Russian mafia to siphon money off the gas trade between Russia and Ukraine.   Pg. 154 - 155  A. I mean, one of the key lines here in the second paragraph says "However, he and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his democratic and other political rivals." So the issue with the Trump Tower meeting, as 1 I understand it, is that the Trump people were eager to accept intelligence from a foreign government about their political rivals and that is, you know, I would say, a form of interference. If you\'re getting help from a foreign government and your help is intelligence, then the foreign government\'s interfering. I mean, you know, I think that also -- of course, in retrospect we now know this was pretty right on target in terms on what it says. So anyway -- Q. In reference to you think that particular sentence? A. I mean, it clearly refers to, you know, them being interested in and willing to -- it depicts them as accepting information. What we have seen to date with the disclosures this year is they were at a minimum super interested in getting information. Q. And when you\'re referencing the "disclosures this year," could you just be specific about that. A. The Trump Tower meeting. Q. So with reference to the June 9th Trump Tower meeting? A. Yes. Yes.  ',
			'Always greatly appreciate the indepth breakdowns. A thankless job, I\'m sure, but means a lot to the community.',
			'Thanks! I also want a add a bit more information on Rinat Akhmetshin and his connections with Russian intelligence and Manafort.  Natalia Veselnitskaya, a lawyer who has been lobbying for the dissolution of the Magnitsky Act and pushing Russian interests, wasn\'t the only Russian operative present at the infamous Trump Tower meeting.  Rinat Akhmetshin is very important as he has ties to Russian intelligence and has a history of being embroiled in court cases related to hacking campaigns;  He has an association with a former deputy head of a Russian spy service, the F.S.B., and a history of working for close allies of President Vladimir V. Putin. Twice, he has worked on legal battles for Russian tycoons whose opponents suffered sophisticated hacking attacks, arousing allegations of computer espionage. Few episodes from Mr. Akhmetshin’s past seem more relevant to Mr. Mueller’s investigation than his work for two Russian billionaires accused of infiltrating their adversaries’ computers during nasty legal battles. The Trump Tower meeting in June 2016 took place less than a week before revelations that hackers had penetrated the Democratic National Committee’s computers and obtained a trove of emails. Investigators have traced digital espionage to Russian spy agencies.  During the same period that Mr. Akhmetshin was accused of being involved in various hacking schemes, he appears to have been nurturing a relationship with Viktor Ivanov, once the deputy head of Russia’s intelligence service, the F.S.B., and until last year a top aide to Mr. Putin.  He has potential ties to the now indicted Paul Manafort and deposed Pro-Russia Ukrainian President Yanukovych;  There, too, Mr. Akhmetshin had tried to ally with Ukraine’s pro-Moscow elements. Before the 2014 invasion, he told reporters, he unsuccessfully sought consulting work with the political party dominated by the nation’s pro-Putin president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. A popular revolt forced Mr. Yanukovych to flee to Russia. Mr. Akhmetshin told journalists that he was a longtime acquaintance of Paul J. Manafort, who served as a high-paid consultant to Mr. Yanukovych for years before becoming chairman of the Trump campaign.

One night, a few blocks over from my office, there was an outdoor K-pop concert taking place while we were working. Part way through the concert, a giant ventilation grate people were standing on gave way and more than a dozen people fell to their deaths. We heard ambulances heading over there but had no idea what happened until later. It shook me up pretty bad because it\'s something I had walked past a hundred times myself and never imagined there was anything unsafe about that area. What happened apparently was that the direction the venue was facing was changed last minute and no one took the standing capacity of the ventilation grate into account. In videos before the incident happened, you could see it sagging pretty badly. ',

When you look at the failure mode of those bolts you see they were not mounted that deep into ceiling and or they were suspended from the concrete itself and not a reinforced member such as a steel beam. (concrete is crap under tension and just pulls apart.)  Seeing as how this is Jakarta... Not shocked, I bet if you inspected the rest of that building or just about any other building in the city they would be loaded with sub standard and out of code construction (even by Indonesian standards). Builders cut corners all the time because they want to save money (to pocket the money and or meet the bid). Also if they messed up and needed to do a quick cheep fix. It\'s also easier to bribe inspectors in some of these countries where cost of living is so low. "What\'s the worse that could happen".

Lee Woo-sung, Seoul\'s chief negotiator, said the North had asked that the art troupe cross the border by foot via Panmunjom, located in the demilitarized zone where a North Korean soldier staged a daring defection to the South in November. "As a standalone North Korean performance may breed criticism that the South set the stage for Pyongyang\'s propaganda, it would be desirable if the two teams perform by turns and then play together a popular song like Arirang for the finale," Cheong said, referring to a folk song shared by the two Koreas.

			'Well, judges can be corrupt in any system, no matter how they are picked. But the American system has a lot of judges being popularly elected to the position. This makes them politicians, which gives them a direct conflict of interest between a) winning votes and b) doing their job fairly. Same deal with district attorneys (government prosecutors) and some sheriffs (local police) which are also elected in many cases.',

			'You deleting it as soon as you receive it? The police not bothering to search you if they don\'t have more information than a single suspicious anonymous tip? But that\'s in practice. In the law, nothing.',
			'Shouldn\'t not removing it but instantly going to the police station and reporting it be a rational behaviour? Like what if you receive it, delete it, and then "cyber-police" catches you and says you \'\'covered evidences". I mean, if I ever get something like this on messanger or e-mail, first thing I\'ll do is to report it to the police.',

I guess the rule is to make it harder for those who buy this stuff to pretend they were "just sent it". ',
			'Surely if you hadn\'t checked your email it would be marked as unread and you\'d have a case that way.',
			'It would certainly help, though if being in receipt of child pornography rather than the viewing of it, am not sure that alone would suffice. Whilst the police should be super-sceptical of a tip-off which leads them to someone who has no child porn other than an unopened email on a standard email address, I wouldn\'t want to rely on them being sceptical. Hard to know how it would play out without looking at the relevant legislation and having knowledge of cases where this has happened.',
			'I would imagine they\'d look for evidence of the email being requested and look into connections between the sender and recipient in real life to see if it was possible the image(s) were requested in person or over the phone, beyond that it\'s probably up to the police officer\'s attitude what the next step is. They\'d definitely go after the sender where possible though and what they say when questioned could well determine your fate.',
			'Yeah. Those who trade in images/footage of child sexual abuse are likely to take many measures to cover their tracks, and so would someone seeking to frame the recipient.  Am hoping there are things that would indicate to the police that the recipient has or has not been using their computer to conceal what they\'re up to in a pattern consistent with consumption of child porn.

			'Oh, i have no doubt that they take every precaution they can but it\'s not much of a match for competent police work; silk road got shut down, admittedly under questionable legal circumstances, and it, I\'m sure, was far more complex than what most pedos could cook up. I would imagine if a pedo was dumb enough to expose themselves by sending unsolicited material to an innocent third party they would not have the gold standard in security (opsec I think they call it on the dark web). Nothing can be actually deleted from hard drives, just the route the computer uses to find that data and it can be recovered in a matter of minutes by specialty police equipment so recovered data can be used to show what a computer was previously used for, I\'m sure there is also some method of recovering IP address history. The kinds of information even Google are allowed to hold and use is staggering.',

Why should the original person be punished but not everyone else that committed the exact same crime? If there was a riot and 100 people got arrested for assault, would you only want to charge the person that started the riot?',
			'Going to be hard to prove all those people didn\'t know it was consensual since they weren\'t the first to share it.',
			'The thing that happened on that video got a lot of media attention, the video itself is a group of teenage boys doing some very disturbing things to an unconscious teenage girl (which ít later turned out wasn\'t just unconscious because of alcohol but because of a seizure) so the contents of the video should be proof enough of the lack of consent',
			'Have you read what happens in the video, it\'s pretty grim.',
			'Im on the fence about the issue but here is my thinking for why it might not be best to charge them all equally. If the first person shared it and knew the people/didnt get permission to share its an issue. What if the other people had no idea there was no permission to share? Yes they shouldn\'t be sharing porn around anyway. but the level of knowledge or involvement is not necessarily the same as with person 1 compared to person 750. Yes its still sharing porn with young people and about minors...but these are teenagers not 40 year olds. Teens engaging in sex with teens is different.',
			'Not being told no doesn’t mean yes.  Hopefully these kids and all their peers will learn a valuable lesson about consent out of this.',
			'I read a article on here about a 14 year old girl who sent a dirty picture via Snapchat and may be charged with a felony. A lot of people were using the excuse that they were teens and not adults so it was ok. Pornography if there is a minor in it is illegal to possess or distribute. Why the hell does the lack of age make this ok? ',
			'Quick question how well can you tell a 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 , 21, 22 etc ... year old apart? Cause when I buy booze people can\'t tell that I am 30 lol ',
			'Because they are teenagers and ruining their lives with a sex crime just doesn\'t seem right. In many progressive states in the US, the only one who\'d likely get in trouble for the dissemination of the video would be the first one that sent it under revenge porn laws. ',
			'ockquote> ruining their lives   You can punish people without ruining their lives. And from what I know about Danish Law, I seriously doubt anybodys life will be ruined because of this.',
			'It doesn\'t sound like it was revenge porn in the normal sense - the girl was unconscious due to a seizure and more than one person penetrated her with various inanimate objects.',
			'Reasonable doubt.',
			'I completely disagree. This is the sexual abuse and humiliation of a child that was memorialized on video. If you are sending this video out, not only are you spreading this child\'s pain, but you are upping the chances that it will be around forever on the internet, that anybody can see it. Distribution is far from a victimless crime. ',
			'I obviously haven\'t seen the video, but I think that you might very well notice that the two 15 year olds are minor. And the idea that anyone would redistribute those doesn\'t sit well with me. :/ But yes, in some of those cases that might be a disproportionate punishment. But that\'s why I guess the courts will choose appropriate punishments based on the circumstances. The police charging someone with something isn\'t the end of it.',
			'I mean, there were enough vids of 15/16 year olds going around during my time in HS, and a lot of them got send around because we were 15/16... It was a dick thing to do sure, but I\'d consider child porn charges a tad bit high. ',
			'How would you notice? 15 and 18 really depends on how early a kid hit puberty. A kit who hit it at 9 is going to look a lot older at 15 than one who hit it at 13 is going to look at 15. And if it is a poor quality video it makes it even harder to tell age.',
			'See the "I think" and "might" in my comment. I mostly just don\'t see any reason why, with today\'s overabundance of free and easily available porn, people would share such a video except because a) they know the people in the video, or b) you can see exactly how old they are. Or maybe that is just a thing teenagers do that completely flew past me. Edit: Or c)  Scandinavian media has also reported that the video shows one of the participants being sexually abused.  I\'m which case I\'m having even less sympathy for anyone who shared it.',
			'ockquote> How would you notice?  This was a video of a high profile sexual abuse case that was all over danish media. Pretty much everyone who shared this video knew what it was and who the victim was.',
			'If this was a group of adults sharing this video, I would agree with you entirely. But they were teenagers, with poor impulse control. And whereas there should possibly be some charge for this, dissemination of child pornography is too extreme even if it fits the elements. ',
			'So far no one knows the scope of the punishment. They\'re mentioning that there\'s gonna be a difference in people who shared the video once and people who have shared it a dozen or a hundred times (since there\'s apparently people who have shared it that much). The ones who shared it once could likely just get away with a fine and an excuse about them now knowing they were minors.',
			'I\'m curious what the legal status is if some teenager lies his age to an adult over the internet to get him exchange naked pics (I am a victim of this)? Does the teenager get any charges if the adult finds out his/her real age and calls the police?',
			'Well the adult reporting the crime would be admitting to sending nude pictures to a minor which is a strict liability crime in most (if not all) states. The police and/or prosecutor may choose to not file charges in light of the circumstances. But I wouldn\'t report it myself.  There may be some laws for misrepresentation you use against the teenager, but it is doubtful they would pursue those as the teenager would be seen as the "victim" of the crime. ',
			'That sucks. In those situations if adult gets charged, teen should also get charged as complicit to crime, because he/she did it willingly & using deceit.',
			'As I said, there are some misrepresentation or fraud crimes that could be used. But no prosecutor is likely to actually charge the teenager in that case as that would be political suicide. ',
			'Prosecutors should never have to consider their political career when choosing whether to do their job properly. That is so fucked up.',
			'This is a civilized country, their lives will not be ruined. Age and single offense will be considered, and they will probably get off easy, and there are no insane regulations about these people having to alert neighbors either. But it will probably be forever in internal police records. But after 5 years not in the criminal record you may need to show to employers who request it.',
			'The people redistributing the video are just as bad. I can\'t see how you can defend this behaviour. Honestly I have absolutely no sympathy for them. It shows a complete lack of moral and civil behaviour. Something they should honestly be capable of at this age. I hope they are made an example of.  The person who had this indecent video spread, without their consent, is the one who has had their life ruined.',
			'Studies have repeatedly shown that the portion of a teenagers brain that controls impulse control is not fully developed the way it is with an adult. Couple that with the normal teenager\'s need to fit in and make friends and the societal norm to share anything of interest and you need to realize how devastating this would be. You can\'t blindly punish without examining the intent of the parties nor the brain chemistry that leads to the formulation of said intent. ',
			'Using this word will catch me a lot of hell......but. Morals today are either routinely ignored or no longer really taught and enforced by parents. A child raised morally that has moral beliefs wouldn\'t have shared or possibly even watched the video. There is too much excuse making for people fucking up and letting them get away with it. If you do the crime you should do the time.....but I\'m 15 is a pathetic excuse. Would you let him get away with murder on an impulse. A sheer lack of respect for others is what it comes down to.....would you want someone to do this to you? No? Then don\'t do it.....it IS that easy.',
			'That is not going to hold up in court. Unless the judge wants to set precedence for \'gang rape\' and other forms of mass sexual assault. I couldn\'t even imagine someone attempting to use this reasoning to justify it, but here we are.  "Oh you see your honor, my brain hasn\'t developed enough to actually have a moral compass, so as you can see I had no choice".  There is absolutely no excuse for this behaviour.',
			'The defense has been used many times in the United States. Some states have amended their laws to not consider this dissemination of child pornography, realizing the laws need to account for evolving technology and the age and development of the offender. But your argument lost all merit when this was likened to gang rape.',
			'ockquote> n  I think life was unfair to you in some way and hence all the salt. I also thought reddit loves mental health issues and supports victims of mental health issues, but i guess that\'s not the flavor of the day. ... P.S. your comparisons suck',
			'To add to the point this happening in Danemark I suppose they will most likely get a mandatory information course on the subject of privacy, consent and the legal responsabilities around it (and I hope by someone who knows his job), get community service as a form of repayment towards society and a compensation for the victim. That\'s how it should be handled (not ruining 1000 teenagers lives or forcing them to go in debt for a massive fine) but it requires a big investment in education and training beforehand. * Just read the article, wow!',
			'I wouldn\'t say just as bad. Teenagers by default don\'t think as much about... well, anything. They don\'t think of the morality of it nor of the consequences. Teenagers are really fucking dumb. I don\'t think punishments should be too harsh. But, there should definitely be consequences. Just cause teens don\'t think of it shouldn\'t mean they should get off scot-free.',
			'Fuck that. Each one of those people shared a video against the will of the person depicted. I say let them go if they didn\'t know what they were doing, but if they knew, same punishment as the rest of them. ',
			'If they knew, and you can prove it, that is revenge porn (at least by US laws) and they could be charged.  Proving that could be very difficult unless the original text said something to make it clear. ',
			'Theyre also minors so... child porn. ',
			'In areas that fail to account for psychology and the development of adolescents. But in an increasing number of jurisdictions minors sharing images of minors engaged in sex acts is not being considered child porn. ',
			'Since a lot of people here seem to be missing the point, I\'ll quote myself from a different Reddit post about this: So a bit of extra information from Denmark (Dane here):  Far more than 1004 people have seen the video - the 1004 are specifically those, where the police have proof that they further shared the video after having received it. Some shared it several hundred times. They are not being charged with possession of child pornography, but with the "distribution of sexual material of someone under 15". In Denmark, it\'s legal to have videos/photos of sexually explicit situations of 15-17 year olds, as long as that media was recorded with the partners consent, and as long as the material is not shared. I\'m not sure why the article mentions "2 15-year olds". The video, which was 4 different short segments, and was of 1 girl (15 at the time) and 4 young men (don\'t know their age). It is highly unlikely they will get any serious jail time, if any at all, because of their young age when it happened (2 years ago, almost everyone that shared it was other high school students). Punishment will most likely be in the form of fines, perhaps community service, and being unable to serve as teachers and police. Something that is left out: the contents of the video is actually fairly disturbing. In one 50-second segment, the girl is slapped 3 times by 3 boys, in two others she\'s penetrated by a baseball bat, a badminton ketcher, and a clothing hanger - while it\'s consensual, she does at one point remark "this isn\'t comfortable". In the last segment, she\'s having sex with 2 boys, while the other two film. I\'ve been told (haven\'t read myself) that she was under the impression that 1 boy was coming over - but 4 boys showed up. The girl in the video has later said, that if it wasn\'t for the immense amount of help she got afterwards, she would have committed suicide because of the entire experience. The Danish "Save The Children" (Red Barnet) has remarked that it\'s the most offensive (in the meaning of the word where "I find genocide offensive", not "I\'m offended by that joke") video ever recorded in Danish history. ',
			'Exactly, distribution isn\'t a victimless crime. This girl had her abuse memorialized on camera without her consent then shared to probably tens of thousands of people. For the rest of her life she\'s not going to know who\'s seen her being abused. It could be her boyfriend, her best friend, the guy serving her lunch at a restaurant. The vulnerability she feels is ridiculous and these people all deserve any charges that come to them for sharing that.

			'Serious question, if you share naked pictures/videos of yourself taken while you were underage, are you guilty for spreading child pornography? ',
			'Bizarrely yes, and in a way it gets worse. In the UK if you are under 18 and you take an indecent picture of yourself you can get a criminal record.  In the UK, a 14-year-old girl and two 14-year-old boys have all had their details added to police databases after sharing a naked photo between themselves. The photo was taken by one of the boys in question – he then snapchatted it to the girl, and she screenshot it, before sharing it around the school. Eventually, parents and teachers got involved. And then it came to the attention of the police, who – because of a loophole in the law that means anybody under the age of 18 who takes a naked photo and sends it to a friend can be charged with creating indecent images of children – recorded it as a crime. The thing is, if you’re over the age of 16, you’re legally allowed to have sex. Meaning that two 16-year-olds could have sex, and face no legal consequences. But if they exchange topless photos of one another, they could be charged with child pornography.  I believe the Laws in the UK are playing catch up with technology so have been rushed through with no consideration which is causing people under the age of 16/18 issues.',
			'Including consensual image sharing between teenagers in the definition of child porn is crazy edit: to elaborate a bit more, I think in an ideal world this image sharing between teenagers should fall in a separate category entirely as it is very different from an adult taking and sharing sexual content of children. I\'m not saying there shouldn\'t be consequences (particularly in these situations where people receive the content and spread it around the school or what have you), but the idea of lumping kids exploring their sexuality in with child predators and other sex offenders just doesn\'t seem to be the best way to handle these situations',
			'The loop hole is intentional. However there is a statement and historical evidence that they have no intention of prosecuting fully consenting exchange of nudes between underage people.  Statements such as yours are VERY damaging, it\'s misinterpreted/intentionally alarmist information that young people see and then are too afraid to come forward when they are a victim. Rather than telling parents/police they hide it out of fear, it\'s irresponsible to claim otherwise.

Being prosecuted through the criminal justice system is likely to be upsetting and distressing for children especially if they are convicted and punished. The label of sex offender that would be applied to a child or young person convicted of such offences is regrettable, unjust and clearly detrimental to their future health and wellbeing."',

The government was the one who provided the fake ID although in no way knowingly. ',

According to police, only a handful had distributed it several hundred times, whereas most of those charged had only shared it a few times. The charges come as police and internet companies the world over have come under pressure to clamp down on "Revenge porn," where a former spouse uploads intimate photographs or videos of their old partner on the internet.

			'I think that taking a video and uploading it without consent SHOULD be illegal and prosecuted appropriately. But, I do have a concern. Two, really. 1) What were the ages involved? If this is a bunch of highschoolers sharing a video of another highschooler, it\'s not like they\'re adult predators coming after a 3 yr old. But they\'re being charged as such from what the article reads. 2)   Kjaerside added that those charged could be placed on Denmark\'s child offense register for at least 10 years and be subject to a criminal record.   So again, sharing a video of a classmate (or someone of a similar age) gets them marked as a pedophile for a decade or longer? This feels extreme.  Now, if it WAS a small child, that\'s certainly different.  Also note I am not saying they shouldn\'t be charged at all; I\'m saying we should think twice before marking someone as a child molester for much of their life.',
			'Just to clarify. This is not a US court. Precedence dictates a typical sentence of 20 days conditional. The reference to a sex offender list isn\'t comparable either. The list is not public. It only means that they cannot get a certificate allowing them to work with children. An employer cannot ask for this unless it is relevant. And I doubt the majority of those charged will get this sanction.',
			'I realize that they technically fall under sex offender laws here, but as far as I\'m concerned there\'s no reason why these children shouldn\'t be allowed to work with children. There is a big difference between a 50 year old man abusing a 7 year old girl and distributing the images to fellow pedophiles and a 16 year old distributing videos of two 15 yo\'s having consensual sex. It\'s two completely different kinds of felonies.',
			'I agree. And thankfully so does the justice system. The standard sentence is 20 days probation (no prison, no sex offender list).',
			'Oh I realize it\'s not a US court, and I\'ll freely admit I don\'t know Denmark\'s laws re: sex offenders. But I still think this could be questionable. I\'m a teen who takes a compromising picture of my girlfriend. Later, I post it on a revenge site. I get caught. ten years later, after getting out of college, I go to pursue my dream of being a teacher only to find...I\'m not allowed to be a teacher because a court decided I was equivalent to a child molester? Sure what I did was wrong, utterly so...but is it on the same level?',
			'I doubt any of them will be placed on that list. The standard sentence is 20 days probation. If the offender is older, punishment may be more severe.',
			'Who said  equivalent to a child molester. ?  Nobody. Being on the sex offender registry (or their equivalent) is not being on the "child molester registry". There are very few loopholes in sex offender laws for two reasons - firstly it isn\'t an attractive thing for politicians to support, and secondly because it\'s dangerous to create loopholes in sex offender laws. Also, others claim some of the content in the video was graphic and clearly within the realm of sexual assault. Willingly sharing the content takes on a new meaning in that context.',

			'ockquote> Danish police have charged hundreds of children and young men for sharing a video of two 15-year-olds having sex. Although 15 is the age of consent, the charges may constitute distribution of child pornography.  Why do they write "young men" when both boys and girls have been charged in the case? The girl on the video was 15, which is above the age of consent for sex. However 18 is the age of consent for pornographic material.',
			'I assume because some of the people who shared the video were young men over 18.',
			'Did they know the age of the couple in the video before they shared it? Some 15 year olds look deceptively older and vice versa.',
			'The problem is that even if they look 15, if a 15 year old shares a video of other 15 years old, he\'s not gonna think "oh, wait, is this child pornography?" to a 15 year old it would be child pornography if the depicted people were like 12 or under. 15 year olds are just same aged peers to other 15 year olds, even if to an adult it would clearly be child pornography.',
			'I think the true problem is we no longer differentiate teenagers from children. Today, we say if you are under 18, then you are a child. Regardless of the realities of the situation. A 10 year old and a 15 year old are light years apart from one another developmentally. That 15 year old is closer in development to a 20 year old, but we set this arbitrary line and punish young adults for their stupidity as if they were adults. It makes no fucking sense.',
			'A 15 year old is a child. I do understand what your trying to say, but a child at 15 has the same consent levels as at 12 (at least in most western countries). If a 40 year old dates a 20 year old it is still kind of gross and well outside the influence of their respected peers, but at least that 20 year old has legal consent in all aspects of their legal rights.  Even if we ignore just how vile it is to share such content without consent, 15 years old is very young. I don\'t know how old you are, but for me (33 y/o) even people in their early 20\'s seem like children but have had just enough life experience I can personally accept them as adults. That isn\'t to say that I do not treat teenagers with respect, however the naivety of most youths is only something you realise as you get older.',
			'ockquote> A 15 year old is a child. I do understand what your trying to say, but a child at 15 has the same consent levels as at 12  Yeah, but only from an adult perspective. From the perspective of a 15 year old, other 15 year olds aren\'t children, and I think it\'s important to take that into consideration when judging them.',
			'Unfortunately in society an individual\'s perspective has no basis, its the collective of that society that is relevant. And in this society a 15 year old is a child. ',
			'that\'s incorrect though. The circumstance and background to a committed crime is generally taken into account. Like we make a distinction between premeditated murder, manslaughter due to gross negligence, manslaughter due to self defense etc. And for example in the US saying the n-word is mostly not acceptable when done by a white person, but pretty much a non issue when done by a black person etc. Individual circumstance makes a huge difference.

			'I volunteer at schools, speaking to students about science and tech, and talking to their parents and teachers about how to approach it. I try very hard to take a measured stance against these people. If they\'re deep-rooted in their belief, there\'s probably a history and story behind that, which is hard for people to change. Conversations always start with each side assuming each other\'s positions as a result. When I\'m dealing with this in person, I\'ll first try to perceive 3 things:  If this is worth arguing about (some beliefs, such as an inward belief in god, doesn\'t necessarily bring harm; if it does, consider if it\'s worth arguing the harm instead of the root), If they\'re willing to change (otherwise it just gets angrier; start with trying to establish a rapport or common ground before starting), and Identify where they stand and what\'s behind their story - and ultimately, what your goal is when arguing against it.  A debate meant to "beat" an opponent, "justify" yourself, or some other righteous crusade is one worth rethinking. This doesn\'t mean I won\'t find some fun in the stranger positions (particularly flat eathers and other "anti-well-proven science" people - anti-vaxxers have significantly more leeway, and potential to be right, than these guys). But it\'s important to pick our battles and base them on a common ground. Tom Scott recommended a book called Difficult Conversations.

			'Kudos to you :) Sometimes I feel that we seriously need another Enlightenment to counter those anti-science nonsense. &nbsp; In my case it was those quack medicine supporters invaded a post made by another member which gives real life examples of how quack medicine hurts and kills people (including the famous Canadian parent case). They started by blatantly accusing the government taking away the "freedom" to decide what\'s good for children from their parents, then proceeded to claim the government and medical professionals have formed a hegemony to "dominate the interpretation of medicine and therapy and branded the alternative therapy as heresy". Other forum members started to counter their argument, but those supporters immediately drifted to irrelevant topics and reposting the same nonsense a few pages later. The topic drifting teetered for another few pages until a newcomer came in and asked "Could anyone advice me on how to treat my eczema?" &nbsp; Those motherfuckers told him to go for the homeopathy and The Gerson Therapy. &nbsp; That\'s where they really pissed me off. I fully understand that those supporters a.k.a. modern medicine haters would never change their position, but I decided that it was necessary to expose their misinformation, flawed logic and smear campaign on science and modern medicine. So I got dead serious in the "war". In those thousands of replies they almost used every textbook examples of logical fallacies (check out this list for quick reference), spouting common (debunked) arguments and attacks on science/modern medicine, playing on vague words, moving goal posts, shifting burden of proof to the others and many more tricks, while reposting their questionable "academic studies", word-of-mouth evidence, anything that "prove" their quack medicine to be superior over modern medicine and them being the "real cure" vs. "a disguised belief" known as "science". As the argument dragged to a multiple-thread mud fight (each thread has a post limit of 1000), more and more people were sick of their bullshit and left. In the end it became a 2-vs-1 which was me countering their non-stop reposting and misleading claims; the entire debate was a long journey of torment and I had wasted too much time on it, so I left the thread without a word (by now they must be claiming victory over the "allopathic medicine shills"; I should have posted the links to threads which have their faulty claims thoroughly debunked). Besides those despicable shills, the most frustrating aspect of this "war" was the fact that other than a few forum members who tried hard to fight against the quack medicine misinformation, nobody including the mods cared about the debate, even when somebody was suggesting questionable medical advice. This really lets me down and I think I am not going to join this kind of debate on that forum for some time. Sorry for making a long post of rant :P That "war" is really baffling. And thankyou u/rirez for the book suggested :) &nbsp;  Note: besides appeal to tradition/nature/ignorance/etc. fallacies, here are some other common arguments quack science/medicine supporters love to use. They are mostly debunked, but the quack science shills still repost these arguments hoping that nobody would go further and question their validity:  Science is not believable because scientists still don\'t have any consensus about evolution and Big Bang. (Most scientists agreed that evolution and Big Bang is a thing; what they are still debating are the technical details, e.g. when and through what mechanism do they happen) There are still doubts about the validity/effectiveness of science. (Which comes from these quack science supporters for obvious reason) Alternative therapy is a therapy i.e. medical practice, which the modern medical practice also belongs in. (These "therapies" are not proven to be effective so they should not be view on equal terms as scientifically proven medical practices) People believed scientific fact is real. People believed in God. Therefore science is just another belief. (An easy to understand article on "believe" v.s. "believe in". tldr: "believe (that)" is "accepting something is true because of evidence" while "believe in" is "putting your faith into an idea or an object, whether they could be proven to be true or not") Alternative therapy cannot be examined by the standard of modern medical practices because they cannot be "put into the framework of modern medical science". (There is no such thing called "framework of modern medical science"; any practices that are safe and effective, be it traditional or not, are accepted and improved/modernized to become "modern medicine"; this argument is also toxic in the way that it implies alternative therapy to be effective, just not accepted because they were unfairly treated and discriminated by "mainstream medicine", which is not true)  There are many more arguments but my brain starts to hurt so please feel free to add other examples, many thanks :)',

It consists of the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) from the pre-erythrocytic stage. The CSP antigen causes the production of antibodies capable of preventing the invasion of hepatocytes and additionally elicits a cellular response enabling the destruction of infected hepatocytes. The CSP vaccine presented problems in trials due to its poor immunogenicity. RTS,S attempted to avoid these by fusing the protein with a surface antigen from hepatitis B, hence creating a more potent and immunogenic vaccine. When tested in trials an emulsion of oil in water and the added adjuvants of monophosphoryl A and QS21 (SBAS2), the vaccine gave protective immunity to 7 out of 8 volunteers when challenged with P. falciparum.[3]',

Diphtheria, and other diseases that are effectively gone have seen brief resurgences due to anti-vaccination movements. In Africa during the Reagan / Thatcher era of the 1980s we saw several resurgences due to anti-vaccination efforts, and because of a cut in funding to international efforts to fund the vaccination campaign- leading to perfect conditions for an outbreak.

			'I really don\'t understand this headline.',
			'On a power grid, electricity must he produced at the same rate as it is used. If there is an imbalance, the grid will malfunction. The grid operator tells power plants to increase and decrease power as needed (or leaves standing orders with certain plants to increase/decrease under certain circumstances).  The problem comes that conventional power plants have operating limits; you can\'t just slam a huge turbine to full throttle - it takes minutes to rev up. Similarly, power plants have minimum and maximum power ratings, and if you run the plant outside those ratings you can cause reliability or maintenance problems.  Now add wind to the mix - when there is a sudden gust of wind, the turbines rev up and produce more power. This can result in the other power plants dropping to minimum and then saying "that\'s it - we can\'t go lower". If there is still too much power, the grid operator needs to get rid of it somehow. It\'s not allowed to ask the wind turbines to reduce power, so the grid operator has to beg the other power plant "we\'ll pay you extra to reduce power" or beg big users of electricity "please use more electricity. We\'ll pay you a bonus". The battery is useful because it can absorb some if the excess.  This issue if negative pricing happens quite frequently where there is a lot of intermittent wind/solar power. California and Germany for example. Part of the reason is that wind turbines/solar are subsidised, and if they reduce power they can\'t claim the subsidy (the subsidy is paid for actual generation) so they are quite happy to keep producing power even if the have to pay to get rid if it. ',
			'Can you also please explain this part  During the four hour window, the battery discharged electricity for short periods (nine minutes total) four separate times.  Why? Because the battery was full? If the battery can discharge (into the ground?) why can\'t the power generator?',
			'It discharged to the grid. It’s likely that frequency took a dive, so the battery went from charging to outputting to correct the imbalance. There could be a multitude of reasons for the frequency dive, such as a generator tripping offline, a large industrial load connecting to the grid, or a neighboring interconnected grid recalling an export requiring the local grid to make up the difference.  It’s likely that the battery is on regulation, which means it chases the frequency. This means it’s sort of like a first responder. It’s like the paramedic showing up to stabilize someone, but you still need a doctor for the permanent solution. The battery responds and supports frequency until one of the regular, but slower, generators can increase its output to cover the loss. ',
			'How does a battery increase the frequency of a slowing mains? Any wave added to another will cause interference which will result in a non steady frequency combined wave (unless it is a harmonic, ie integer multiple of the mains frequency - but that would not increase the frequency, only the average amplitude).',
			'Im not very well versed in the subject, but I\'d guess that the reason the grid slows down is because of the load. Help with the load, and there\'s nothing to slow it down anymore. ',
			'Frequency is a function of the balance of load and generation. When frequency slows, it is because there is more load than the generation is supplying so the fix is to add more power.  Electric grids are synchronous so every generation source connected is outputting the same waveform all in-phase with each other. Since batteries are DC, they use inverters to create a matching waveform. The inverters are essentially a bunch of cleverly arranged thyristors that use the existing waveform to control when they trigger to create a synchronous simulated 60 50 hz wave which is then smoothed out using filter capacitors to prevent harmonic distortion.  :edit: side note, the gif is for an HVDC converter voltages, but it’s similar enough to get the point across. ',
			'Going to piggyback off your comment, since it\'s related: The Tesla battery at the Hornsdale Power Reserve can respond in milliseconds to frequency response needs, versus seconds to minutes for traditional inertial (lot\'s o spinning mass) generators:  Data from AEMO (and gathered above by Dylan McConnell from the Climate and Energy College) shows that the Tesla big battery responded four seconds ahead of the generator contracted at that time to provide FCAS (frequency control and ancillary services), the Gladstone coal generator in Queensland. But in reality, the response from the Tesla big battery was even quicker than that – in milliseconds – but too fast for the AEMO data to record. Importantly, by the time that the contracted Gladstone coal unit had gotten out of bed and put its socks on so it can inject more into the grid – it is paid to respond in six seconds – the fall in frequency had already been arrested and was being reversed. Gladstone injected more than Tesla did back into the grid, and took the frequency back up to its normal levels of 50Hz, but by then Tesla had already put its gun back in its holster and had wandered into the bar for a glass of milk. So why did the Tesla big battery respond when not contracted? One reason is because it can, and so it did. The interesting thing here is the speed with which Tesla responded to the contingency FCAS market, which is triggered after frequency gets to 49.8Hz. That was pretty much instantaneous. And they did it from a standing start, unlike the other generators. Tesla weren’t officially playing in that market, but just wanted to show what they could do. And they did.

AC therefore, is the pedals being pushed down and pulled up without ever doing a full rotation. So the chain, viewed from the top, would just be going forwards and backwards without ever really moving far from its starting position. It does that 50x a second. Now imagine you put a load on the chain. Like a brake. The frequency slows down. So you need more energy to push/pull the pedals. I\'m not saying it\'s the same, but it\'s similar. The battery keeps the frequency at 50hz by adding more energy to the "pedals".',
			'I don\'t understand why the AC version under load has the chain move slower - why wouldn\'t it just move not as far? In the DC version the correct analogy would be that under load the gears change but the speed of the chain and the pedaling remains the same.',
			'How many punches can you do in a minute? Now how many punches can you do with a 10kg dumbell in your hand? If the second is lower, and it should be, then it indicates that you need more energy to keep the same number of punches per minute.',
			'Unless I punch further away from the body workout weights and just 1cm punches with the weights.',
			'In which case you\'re doing less work, using less energy.',
			'I believe it has to do with phase and phase sequence. ',
			'The ELIF version is that over, or under, production of electricity results in variation from the 60hz (in the US) rate for electricity - remember that it is AC, not DC power. The old school way to monitor the supply / demand of electricity was to literally monitor a clock. If it ran too fast, too much electricity was on the grid. ',
			'The battery alone cant do that because it is DC voltage, there has to be power inverter that takes energy from the battery and makes it to AC voltage and pumps it into grid.',
			'That part i presumed. It does not help us understand how it can it alternative the frequency of the mains. Others have explained it though.',
			'So to reduce it to the simplest explanation, the battery is performing complex load balancing?',
			'Probably less like load balancing and more like buffering. Very quick reactions to the grid having a surplus of power or not enough. The battery can pull power out or put it back in (and switch between the two) far quicker then power plants or industry can react. ',

			'ockquote> buffering cacheing ',
			'Yes, but I would clarify it as gen/load balancing.  The grid uses 3-phase power and “load balancing” more traditionally refers to the distribution operators balancing the load across the phases and not the matching of total generation to total load. ',
			'Yes, which is exactly what the battery was build for',
			'Probably because the grid needed it due to a sudden and short term shortage of power. Bulk electricity prices are typically only set every 30 minutes. But faster response may be needed, so there was probably fluctuation in the grid between too much and too little power so the battery kept switching from charge to discharge. These fluctuations were too fast to show up on the price. ',
			'I think its meant discharged into the grid i.e. the reason it exists',
			'Preface: the water analogy breaks down as soon as you get remotely technical, and it\'s a little misleading in specific respects, but it works pretty well for situations like this. Consider the generator as a pump in a reservoir system; the battery is the reservoir itself. The pump can be pumping or not pumping. It\'s a binary state (for simplicity\'s sake.) It has a flow rate and it\'s on or it\'s off. It takes a while to turn on and a moment or to to switch off, as well. When people are using water at about the same rate as the pump is bringing it up, things work more or less optimally. When people are using more than the pump can pump, the reservoir holds <x> extra water to keep things moving while you sort out a solution. But what if the load is hovering right around the pump\'s flow rate? For 90 minutes, the load is slightly higher than the pump\'s flow rate, so the reservoir is draining very slowly. Then everybody goes to the movies and stops using water, but the pump is still going. The reservoir begins to fill up rapidly. There is nothing the pump can do about this. It\'s just pumping water out of the river and into the reservoir and feeding the mains and that\'s what it does. You don\'t want to turn the pump off, though, because any minute now, everybody\'s going to come back from the movies and start using a lot of water again, and it\'ll take half an hour to restart the pump. So you open a spillover gate, and let some water out of the reservoir really quickly. Then you close it, and let the reservoir start to fill up again, and if it fills before the load increases, you discharge it some more.',

My mind is imagining something firing lightning bolts out though I’m sure that’s unrealistic. Maybe something like a gigantic heater or tesla coil - something that just consumes totally massive levels of electricity.',
			'That\'s what the battery\'s for. It provides a place to put excess power without it going to waste, because power is valuable.',
			'Oh, I thought this was about those batteries also being full though. Like I think some device like this should exist on the grid anyway, like an emergency depresuurizing valve.',
			'You can have load banks - giant resistance heaters that just create heat. But from the sounds of it the batteries weren\'t full, rather they were buffering the electrical load- absorbing power spikes and discharging when power was needed.  The battery controllers likely have some advanced programming to cause them to remain at say... half charge so they are both able to absorb power and provide extra power at any given time.',
			'If a device like that did exist, it would probably cost more to operate than they pay to get rid of extra electricity from the grid.',
			'That\'s it! send the extra electricity to some crypto mining devices!!',

If you owned such a device attached to the australian grid at the time of this event you could absolutely have made money. But it\'s unclear how often this happens; most of the time your electricity exhaust device would just sit there doing nothing. It\'s so easy to do that it\'s kinda a risky investment. It would probably make more sense to just have a virtual exhaust device. There are already programs where people with nest thermostats connected to air conditioners can be remotely deactivated if the utility company needs to kill some load fast on a summer day. They could do the opposite. But that said, they also sometimes have distribution problems and the load sometimes needs to be attached to the grid in a specific place.',

The grid operator has to pay massive compensation called "constraint payments" if they need wind turbines to reduce output. ',
			'Sure it can, but the response isnt instant, the fastest control we have is a battery like this. This battery was build for exactly this purpose.',

			'In most market based area there is no longer a formal concept of a baseload unit. Instead, they are “market price takers” which means they are going to output X amount of power no matter what the market price is. This is actually why we see negative prices like in the article. We have too many generators who want to output their power, but not enough load to meet it. Prices will go negative to incentivize generators to turn off.  Nuke plants, for example, have to look at the opportunity cost of turning off or lowering output. They are fairly slow at changing output so chasing a short term negative price might mean they miss out on a much higher positive price in future settlement intervals. This means they will pay the negative price or take a non-profitable rate to generate (like overnight) on the assumption that they can offset the loss when prices are extremely high (like over the daily peak).',

There are also special units that basically keep everything \'balanced\' that will instantaneously move to keep frequency within an acceptable range. The system operator can switch off units if required of course, some of my units are armed for "Generation Rejection" which gives the grid operator authority to trip my units off if the system requires it (more preferable to tripping my entire facility and blacking everything out via opening the main breaker or just removing the line further down).  I should also mention generators have the ability to absorb power off the system via excitation control, if the voltage starts rising the units will act on their on accord to absorb power from the system to keep voltages within a tolerable range. They are capable of doing the opposite as well, the rules changed a lot after the big black out in 2003. These days generators are required to run in a dynamic nature to prevent systemic collapse of the entire system, if all the units connected do a little work the system is able to self-balance much more effectively. TLDR; if the grid starts to sag due to under-generation generators can pickup this slack, they are capable of doing the opposite (to a degree - if everyone is pinned at 100% and there\'s too much load then you start having brownouts.).',

But no, apparently the way these trees lived was way more extreme:  The polar forest grew at a latitude where plants can’t grow today and he believed they must have been an extremely hearty species in order to survive... “There isn’t anything like that today,” he said. “These trees could turn their growing cycles on and off like a light switch."... The trees are believed to have been able to survive by living nearly half the year in absolute darkness followed by up to five months of continuous light. ',

			'It\'s not just a few more months. In subarctic regions, you have a chunk of total night and a chunk of total day, but the rest of the year sees both day and night.

			'ockquote> For one trees which cant actually grow through ice. That should be self evident.  The trees didn\'t have to grow through ice:  By the Lopingian Epoch the climate warmed from an icehouse to a greenhouse environment with the southern polar regions reconstructed as boreal or temperate climates (Francis et al., 1994; Fielding et al., 2010; Roscher et al., 2011). Polar forests were structured so the plants were able to take advantage of the limited light that was available (Taylor and Ryberg, 2007) with an open canopy with slender conical-shaped trees and vertically arranged leaves (Jahnke and Lawrence, 1965; Creber and Chaloner, 1984; Cúneo et al., 1993). The Permian forests were able to thrive due to the combination of higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (Berner and Kothavala, 2001; Kiehl and Shields, 2005; Birgenheier et al., 2010) and the pole to pole extent of Panthalassa which allowed warm tropical waters to flow to polar regions (Kutzbach and Ziegler, 1993; Parrish, 1995) creating globally warmer climates with less latitudinal difference in climate zones than what is observed today (Kiehl and Shields, 2005; Roscher et al., 2011). -- DeWitt, Shelby, et al.

One thing that seems disingenuous to me is the comparison between circumcision and female genital mutilation. Female circumcision, if it can even be called that, aims to remove the entire clitoris. The standards may shift, from sterile to horrific, depending on where it is and who is doing it, but this is a fundamental difference. Circumcision does not remove the entire penis. Just the foreskin. Best comparison would be removing the clitoral hood on females. Whether it is right to do that to non-consenting infants is another issue entirely, but claiming these two practices to be the same is dishonest. It\'s why I can understand male circumcision, while being right behind everyone else on detesting female circumcision.',
			'Removing the clitoral hood is Type 1A FGM and is illegal in the US. There is currently a federal case pending against a Michigan Doctor for "nicking" the clitoral hood of several girls.',

			'In most places where both are legal, the tools, hygiene, and so on are generally comparable, except where outside influence (mostly American-backed circumcision campaigns) alters that. In Malaysia they do both in sterile clinics, in other places both happen in unhygienic conditions with bizarre tools.  Even in Britain and America ridiculous practices sometimes occur in circumcisions because this almost completely unregulated: none of those models who gave babies herpes in New York were prosecuted for reckless endangerment or anything of that sort, or even liable to be sued for negligence, and nor was the midwife who circumcised a boy with a box cutter when the boy bled to death. ',
			'This is a common misconception. There are many different forms of FGM. The ones were they cut off the clitoris are certainly worse than circumcision. But another common form is where they cut off the clitoral hood or the labia, which is anatomically analogous to the male foreskin. According to the WHO, even pricking a girls genitals is considered genital mutilation. So, theres no reason why male circumcision shouldn\'t be considered genital mutilation.',
			'Solid reasoning. Since most arguments I hear against female circumcision come at it from the practice of clitoral removal, my initial post addressed it as if that were the default. My experiences with the clitoral hood are limited to piercings and foreplay. Sensitive topic as female mutilation is, and for very good reason, I have to ask: is there any medical disadvantage to tampering with the clitoral hood? For male foreskin, the effect of circumcision is benign, but I\'m honestly ignorant as to whether or not there is lasting damage if the clitoral hood is tampered with.',
			'It really depends on the woman. If her external clitoris is short and ordinarily wholly covered by her labia majora, the damage is minimal (and in rare circumstances it can be beneficial). If it is exposed all the time then there is a period of a few weeks or a couple of months of hyper stimulation, followed by a desensitisation and hardening (which happens to almost all circumcised men).',
			'I would like to make another argument: is cutting children for non medical reasons ethical, and or violating their autonomy by not having the person\'s consent? ',
			'I do think that circumcision helps enable FGM, because disingenuous or not people make comparisons between them all the time. Worse, unscrupulous agitators use those comparisons to spread divisions and undermine progress on ending FGM. By saying "some circumcision is okay", we change the discussion to one of degree rather than kind. I think ending circumcision would actually do a lot to help end FGM.',

The Glans is an internal organ and is protected by the foreskin, which is a frictionless bearing that rolls over the Glans, rather than slides. Google image search "keratinisation Glans" to see how circumcision negatively impacts the health and sensitivity of the Glans. Why would anyone decide for an infant that this is how they should live for the rest of their life? What is the point? What right does anyone have to do this to another person without their consent?',

Hell, they may not be interested in self mutilation so if i get them before consent its all the easier',
			'Corsets on their own aren\'t damaging (you should see the fashion she\'ll choose in her teen years), though corseting can be. And feet crushing will obviously handicap her. You missed the part where I said that respect for cultural practice ends where it has lasting effects on the individual\'s life. Rearranging organs and crippling their feet have very obvious effects. Thus, foreskin removal is about as horrifying as wisdom teeth removal, since my aerodynamic model still runs just fine. It\'s the effects of clitoral hood tampering that I\'m curious about (since circumcision doesn\'t remove the penis, clitoral hood is a closer comparison than the universally-abhorrent clitoris removal), and that question has been answered elsewhere.',
			'ockquote> If we didn’t need a foreskin, why are we born with one?   Same reason we are born with a post-anal tail and appendix. It\'s largely vestigial. You don\'t need a foreskin.

			'Scotland didn\'t vote for it, not that that matters any more. Interesting to note we\'ve had no studies on the impact which have been released by the Westminster government, and they insist such studies have both been done and haven\'t been done.',
			'dam true',
			'ockquote> Scotland didn\'t vote for it, not that that matters any more.  Always good to trot this old "Better Together" tweet.',
			'Lots of places didn\'t vote for it.',
			'Not a single constituency within Scotland had a majority vote to Leave. There\'s a bit of a difference there.',
			'And assides that, a majority of people didnt vote for it either. I work in elsewhere in europe, the local commune is convinced the UK has already left the EU and is making it difficult to renew my work visa.',
			'ockquote> And assides that, a majority of people didnt vote for it either  Uh.... What? How do you figure that. What was the referendum for, then?',
			'I think he means that there were a whole bunch of non-voters as well. Whether that would have swung the vote is an entirely different discussion.',
			'It\'s kind of silly though, because by the same logic a majority didn\'t vote to remain either lol.',
			'That\'s true. Whether or not it is a good idea to start counting non-voters I\'m not sure. I could see the benefit of counting non-voters as status-quo voters, meaning that an absolute majority of the population would have to vote for change, but I\'m not sure if it\'s the right way to do it.',
			'No. Counting non voters as anything is a ludicrous idea.',
			'It kind of makes sense if you\'re voting to either maintain a status quo or to change something. That change would require a majority of the population. It would definitely bias a vote towards the status quo, but if a majority of the population isn\'t willing to vote for changing it, perhaps it\'s not worth changing. But IMO the idea of holding referendums on huge policy changes like this is a bit ridiculous. That\'s what representative democracy is for.',
			'It seems to be a peculiar growing right-wing trend to \'co-opt\' non-voters one way or the other to support their point of view. It\'s the modern day equivalent of that old favourite phrase beloved of psychic right-wing politicians "The Silent Majority". :O In referenda or in elections there is one constant that needs endlessly repeating; eligible non-voters opinions do not count . ',
			'We mandatory voting in Australia. You just get stupid situations like people voting because they like the sound of the name but have no idea what they represent. Example, the sex party, the cannabis party, the car party.',
			'Well, it would make referenda basically impossible to win, so that\'s a good thing.',
			'Its funny, because leaving the UK would cost the Scottish economy far more. Yet many of the same people lamenting leaving the EU economic area were pandering for leaving what is essentially the UK economic area, which mattered far more',
			'The problem now is that relying on an economy which is going to be declining (the rUK) is not a good situation. It would have been best for Scotland to concentrate on growing trade internationally, and particularly to Europe. Of course, that is now not going to happen once the trade barriers are in place. We now have a very bleak future as part of a declining state. I support independence, but I honestly don\'t really care any more, I think the country is finished either way.',
			'ockquote> Its funny, because leaving the UK would cost the Scottish economy far more.  My impression is that they would leave the UK to rejoin the EU and I\'m sure the EU would be happy to have them if only to thumb its nose at the UK.  the UK economic area, which mattered far more  What is this based? Something more substantial and demonstrable than nationalistic sentiment, I hope.',
			'ockquote> What is this based? Something more substantial and demonstrable than nationalistic sentiment, I hope.  "Scotland\'s trade with the rest of the UK continues to be worth four times more than its exports to the EU, according to Scottish government figures." The main factor in trade is geography which is why trade with the EU is more important than trade with the rest of the world for the UK, and why trade with the rest of the UK is more important than trade with the rest of the EU for Scotland.',
			'Isnt the UK trying for a free trade agreement with the EU? If scotland got their EU membership and you dont get brits refusing to buy scottish goods, right move is leaving the UK',
			'The problem with that kind of thinking is that admitting independent-Scotland would require a unanimous vote of the EU, and there\'s zero chance Spain will assent, due to their own regions with independence movements. Sure, you can logically distinguish the two cases, but even if you and I can, pro-independence Catalonians, etc., will take ANY acceptance of Scotland into the EU as evidence that they could hope for admission as well.',
			'ockquote> and there\'s zero chance Spain will assent, due to their own regions with independence movements.  Actually Spain has said they have no problems with Scotland joining the EU because it\'s a different situation to Catalonia. Scotland is already a mostly autonomous country within the UK and if they left they\'d do it through legal means like a referendum performed by Westminster. I\'d say the urge to stick it to England is greater than the urge to keep them out because of Catalonia. ',
			'Got a quote for that? Goes against a lot of the reporting on the topic.',
			'ockquote> there\'s zero chance Spain will assent  Blatant lies.',
			'When they had the Scottish independence vote the EU said they would have to meet the joining criteria and then apply to join, an independent Scotland still wouldn\'t meet the joining criteria, so there is nothing saying they would get in. What he was saying was that the people wanting independence which would mean leaving the EU before, are now against Brexit when they have the same ending, Scotland out of the EU. Also the trade with the rest of the UK accounts for multiple times the amount of trade Scotland does with EU. Currently its trade with the UK is 4 times larger then its trade with the whole of the EU.  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38743532',
			'no they allready came out saying scotland would never be able join the eu.',
			'The EU stated with no mincing of language that an independent Scotland would NEVER be able to join the EU? Ci-fucking-tation, if you please.',
			'no its because of Catalonia if you let Scotland join you gotta let Catalonia join and anyway why would they even let scotland join they run at a deficit ',
			'did the EU say it wouldn\'t let them join as an independent nation, or as they are now? because that\'s a big difference, and what EU says now is only meant to help Spain remain stable - prevent option A) independent nation of Catalonia, same as independent Scotland would be... it can\'t prevent them from joining afterwards, or atleast not without raising some serious eyebrows',
			'no it did say if the thousnads on posts that ive read abut brexit there was a couple that stated that they said they wernt allowed and tbf it would not be beneficial for eu to allow scotland to join anyway it would be allowing some 1 like greece join now at their current state.',
			'You seriously couldn’t sound more dumb if you tried.',
			'The results for the independence referendum were 45-55 mostly based on this factor, however we are still going to get economically shat on regardless now because of Brexit. So I don’t see how it’s so absurd for the majority of Scotland to be lamenting over this.',
			'I remember a certain "What\'s our best way of removing our EU membership? Voting yes" slogan. So depressing now.',
			'36% of SNP voters, voted to leave the EU (almost identical to Labour) https://lordashcroftpolls.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/LR-by-party.jpg I\'d be curious to know actually, how many SNP supporters voted \'leave\' in an attempt to secure Indyref2?',
			'[deleted]',
			'No its not.  It\'s counted by constituencies because that\'s what the system is familiar with, and its a lot easier to use the same polling stations and counting centres that you use in a normal election. Results are periodically presented on a constituency basis by the media (if only because its an interesting angle). But the result of a referendum most definitely hinges on the total cast for X against the total cast for Y. There are no constituency demarcations involved in arbitrating the result. What you\'re suggesting is fundamentally wrong',
			'That\'s a good few percent of GDP. Like a bad war.',
			'So Scotland will be the one paying the £350m a week?',
			'100m* since the uk gets 250 back. ',
			'quick maffs',
			'I think if anyone knew what was going to happen the vote would have been further from 50/50.',
			'It was closer to 60(remain)/40 in Scotland.',
			'Specifically; Remain: 62% Leave: 38%',
			'It is true that generally Scotland, Irish border, and central London voted remain, and much of the rest voted leave, making the 50/50 not quite the whole story when inspecting particular regions. Funnily enough reading around the topic more, it seems Whales also generally voted leave, which makes no sense, as they receive more/as much funding per person as Scotland does from the EU. ',
			'If England\'s politicians didn\'t go limp wristed over the issue perhaps this could have already been settled.  No normal person sees any of this money anyways, this is all "wall street money" that wealthy people make off of the people\'s backs anyway.',
			'I wouldn\'t bet on it this time, the rich will be the ones who can weather this storm the "best" with their offshore money.',
			'Stock exchanges love imported cheap labor.',
			'Scotland blew it the first time - because Scotland did not want Independence, just the oil money. Scotland even wanted to keep the Pound. This proves Scotland didn\'t want Independence, and now the oil price has gone down $1 u/tippr',
			'Also if Scotland did vote for independence they would have left the EU too, since the EU even said they would have to apply to join and meet the joining criteria which they don\'t.',
			'Other MEPs have already addressed this issue and said that Scotland could be considered a successor state to the UK\'s exit, or fast-tracked in.',
			'They\'ve said this now that the UK is leaving, but they weren\'t saying it during the independence referendum. ',
			'could but won\'t. ignore the austerity unions propaganda',
			'Does Scotland even make 16bn a year? That\'s a lot of Scotch and haggis...',
			'Don\'t forget bagpipe lessons',
			'Note this is a worst case scenario and even so would only last a few years until the economy adapted/stabilised to the change. Of course I get downvoted for being realistic and not going along with the UK we fall apart because of brexit circlejerk',
			'As someone about to finish university, this is a few years I can’t really afford to waste on the dole. At this point it would be beneficial for me to do what other professionals and grads are doing, and simple leave this sinking ship for a better life on the mainland.',
			'Again this is a worst case scenario but if you want leave your country instead of trying to make it a better place based on something you don\'t know will happen that is your choice.',
			'You tend to get down-voted for being realistic here. Its pointless making predictions until we\'re actually bloody out of the EU in the first place, right now its just scare mongering to get people to beg for a second referendum.',
			'Yea it\'s just sad that reddit has become this, people used to debate politics/ideas here but now It\'s mostly just circle-jerking and using the downvote button as a disagree button if you go against the grain. Unless you are really being a dick.'
