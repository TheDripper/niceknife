			'This awesome online tool from the Stockholm Environment Institute shows exactly who’s growing each ton of soy, who’s buying it, how it’s shipped and who’s the major investor in the process.  You can also see which producers and farms are in areas of deforestation, and therefore who’s responsible. https://trase.earth',
			'Why on earth is The Netherlands and Spain buying so much soy?',
			'Like half the Spanish sentences I know start with soy, that’s probably it',
			'Yo no soy la selva amazónica',
			'Yo no soy marinero.',
			'Yo no soy merinero!',
			'Soy capitan! ',
			'¡Soy capitan!',
			'Laaaa la bamba',
			'ಠ_ಠ',
			'golf clap',
			'My guess: The Netherlands produces a shit-ton of cheese, which requires cows, which require a heckload of soy feed. Spain produces a lot of beef and pork as well.',
			'Netherlands also produces a lot of Soy Sauce , Kikkoman (the japanese Brand) has a major plant there',
			'Why is it in NL?',
			'Taxes.',
			'Probably distribution too. Kikkoman is probably one of the world\'s most popular soy sauce brand. Having a western factory allows them to ship it to their markets cheaper.',
			'Likely tax reasons. And having a factory in Europe lets them more cheaply distribute to the entire EU.',
			'probably because rotterdam is the one of biggest ports of transshipment in europe',
			'Because we love sushi in The Netherlands',
			'well it doesn\'t require soy feed but they do that because it\'s cheaper and makes them fat faster. which is fucked up in it\'s own special way.',
			'This is true for beef cattle. Dairy cows have zero reason to get fat faster. Soy meal is used as a protein supplement but their diet is always majority grass of some sort (grass if grazing, hay, barley, alfalfa, etc if not). Grains (including corn and soy) will typically make up less than 1/4 of a dairy cow diet. Also, the corn used to fatten beef cows is done in the last few months before slaughter. They are still majority grass fed until the “finishing” stage and even then still eat mostly grass. 100% grass fed beef just finishing with grass which can take 2-3x longer to get to a slaughter weight and still not weigh as much as a corn finished cow (which is why grass finished beef is so much more expensive). Yes beef cows may have some corn before finishing but it’s not as much as many people think. Finally, soy doesn’t really make sense to cheaply “fatten faster”, it’s used mostly as a protein supplement to help them produce more milk (since producing milk takes protein) so they can maximize yields. This is how it is in the US at least, i can’t speak specifically for NL but I just assume the US does it the worst way when it comes to anything that isn’t foie gras or veal.',
			'ockquote> [cows] require a heckload of soy feed.  Though the cheese connection is likley the answer, we have different definitions of "require".  Whats that Hancock quote about it being the mark of a truly insane society. (Destroying the planets lungs, to grow soy to feed cows)',
			'Ironic, one of the largest Dutch importers Cefetra BV has all kinds of sustainability blabla on their website.',
			'The Netherlands probably because they\'re the second biggest food exporter in the world after the US.',
			'Also how much responsible soy is sourced from unresponsive sources? ',
			'We need more of this and we especially need this info integrated into an app with a bar code so consumers can vote with their dollars.',
			'Can someone compile a list of these companies and post it to world news? It concens all of us. Boycott this trash.',
			'Boycott eating meat and you\'ll make a huge dent in your soy intake',
			'Cutting back on meat, particularly beef is the single biggest impact an individual can have on stopping this madness. I can’t stop completely, I just have to have a fuckin steak sometimes, but I’m tryin lol. Down to beef like once every two weeks. Probably about as close as I’ll ever get, but I know it helps compared to when I ate it like 3 or 4 times a week. ',
			'Cargill is, among other things, the processor of lunchmeat for Walmart\'s Prima Della brand. We stopped buying there about ten years ago after we found out. We pay four dollars more a week for lunch meat now for sandwiches, but it\'s doubly worth it because the meat tastes better, too.',
			'Damn, Brazil is a huge consumer of soy, also interesting to see the Louis-Dreyfus name on there',
			'Soylent is in there damn',
			'"for processed foods" Call it like it is, its to feed cattle. Almost all Amazon rain forest destruction is for animal agriculture, but they avoid telling people this. Why? Because it makes animal agriculture look bad. ',
			'This is the truth not OP\'s BS title. The world has lost half of its rainforest land in the last 50 years. 90% of that went towards raising cattle and growing food for cattle to eat. Studies project we\'ll reach nine billion people by 2050. At the present rate of land consumption we can\'t sustain meat production to feed that many people. We\'re already over fishing the oceans to try and meet demand. The sad part is global agriculture currently produces enough calories to feed 11 billion people worldwide, however, the majority of this food gets fed to livestock while 100 million people are starving to death and 815 million are undernourished. Theoretically we could cut greenhouse emissions by more than half if we switched meat in our diets to grains and beans.',
			'all this while 33% of all food produced is thrown out. not fed to people, not fed to animals, just wasted entirely.',
			'Ugh.... I\'m going to hate this so much, but, I\'m going vegetarian. This is all I needed to read. Wish me luck boys! ',
			'If you feel like you need more substance in your food, check out Indian recipes. Half of their culture has been vegetarian for hundreds of years, if not millennia. There\'s almost more veg dishes than non veg, and it can be great to keep things interesting.',
			'Thai also has spme great choices',
			'Also pretty much all veg Indian meals (excluding things which are paneer based) can be made vegan if you use coconut oil instead of ghee/butter!',
			'Join us over at /r/vegan. We\'re a happy community we promise! If you need plant based tips I\'m happy to help you on your journey!',
			'Go for it! I have been vegan for nearly a year in part because of these reasons. No regrets!',
			'A lot of people seem to think vegans only do it for the animals, other humans and our planet are huge reasons most people overlook',
			'Vegans, like any group of people, are multifaceted. Personally, I don\'t think the reasons are not so much overlooked, but don\'t want to be seen.',
			'I made the switch to vegan 3 years ago, and if I could offer you one piece of advice it would be to buy a couple cookbooks and learn to love cooking. Thug Kitchen: Fast as Fuck has some dope meals that are easy and fast to prepare',
			'Thug Kitchen is the bomb. He\'s new on the scene but I\'ve been cooking a lot of Avant Garde Vegan. He has a huge Instagram and Youtube following. He takes vegan food and gives it a fine dining edge. He\'s awesome!  For "junk food" it\'s hard to beat Candice at Edgy Veg. She shows you how to make common "junk food" dishes at home and all vegan.  I\'m Kiwi so I\'ve never had real "Chick-Fil-A" but I made her version out of seitan and it was UNREAL.',
			'Not a vegan but my wife and I make that burrito recipe all the time, so damn good! ',
			'Good luck!! Honestly there is a lot of really delicious vegetarian food out there, the most difficult part comes if you aren’t used to making a lot of meals/planning meals somewhat ahead of time, more and more restaurants are offering vegetarian/vegan options but to get really delicious vegetarian food you end up having to make it yourself (or going to Indian/Lebanese/etc places) Also some grocery stores now have a decent selection of vegetarian frozen foods (found in the frozen aisles) and meat supplements (usually found by the vegetables)  Anyways really hope you can make this work out for you, even if you can’t commit to going fully vegetarian/vegan it can still be really helpful to at lest cut down your meat consumption and introduce more vegetarian options into your meals ',
			'Good luck and check out r/vegan for guidance! ',
			'Exactly a month ago I decided not to eat more meat. It has been tough and I\'ve regressed to eating fish sometimes, but I haven\'t touched red meat in 30 days and it feels great. You can do it!',
			'You can do it!!!! ',
			'You\'ll find lots of support for transitioning at /r/vegan and /r/vegetarian . You can do it!',
			'You will love it! Good luck :) ',
			'Please consider if not going vegan, cutting out cheese and even eggs. Some people cut out meat and then just replace it with cheese, which still means animal agriculture.',
			'Wait, are you saying cutting out cheese and eggs has a better ecological impact than cutting out meat? That\'s rough. I think I like cheese and eggs even more than meat...and they go with almost anything, and would be my normal ethical non-meat go-to. Dang.',
			'Think they mean that vegetarianism still contributes to the problem of animal agriculture (raising cattle and chicken) if you continue to consume dairy and eggs. ',
			'It never ends. Even graham crackers, I thought, were wonderfully innocuous, vegan snacks. But they use palm oil, which means rainforest destruction............. And isn\'t soy a major part of tofu?? Aaarrghh....... (ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻',
			'At that point, it\'s important to consider the scale of the effect. I prioritize cutting out animal products because industrialized animal agriculture is responsible for 90% of the deforestation. Meat eaters pointing toward palm oil and soy production are only projecting their own discomfort with supporting these fucked up industries. Cutting back on unsustainably sourced palm oil or monocropped soy is also a positive step, but cutting out meat has more of an effect.',
			'Very true. It can feel hopeless sometimes though! But meat is bad on SO many levels.',
			'It\'s all really bad. Obviously dairy involves raising cattle as well, and eggs involve billions of chickens. Plus there\'s a ton of ethical issues as well. All male laying chicks are ground up at birth because they can\'t lay eggs, and male dairy calves are slaughtered as veal. Both hens and cows are slaughtered once their productivity goes down at a fraction of their natural lifespan. Honestly you\'ll eat way better if you focus on eating a wide variety of plant foods instead of cheese and eggs anyway! It\'s so easy to be vegan and there\'s so many guides and resources online. Focus on replacing, not restraining yourself. Explore new recipes and look up vegan versions of foods you enjoyed before. You\'ll feel more positive that way.',
			'Do it, it helps reduce your carbon footprint immensely. But consider using it as a transition to veganism (generally accepted as the elimination of dairy and eggs, as well as leather etc). It helps that much more. Join us /r/vegan ',
			'I had a bit of a question, and I know the answer will vary because it\'s a personal choice, but still curious. Obviously being vegan is the best option from reducing your carbon footprint, but with the development or process towards creating lab made meat would that change your stance on the matter (Assuming it got rid of the agriculture it\'d be replacing)? I am just curious about the stance on artificial meat because honestly I haven\'t heard too much on it from any vegans/vegetarians I run into. ',
			'That question has been answered on the sub many time before if you want to check it out and in r/debateavegan as well.',
			'Good question. You\'re right that the opinion will vary between vegans, but I\'d say the vast majority of us support the development of lab meat (aka clean meat). And from what I\'ve seen, it supposedly reduces the carbon footprint of the meat substantially - to the point where it\'s not a big argument against it. Remember that the central goal of veganism is to reduce harm wherever it\'s practical to do so. And so if/when lab meat gains mass popularity, it would go a LONG way in reducing animal suffering. Personally, I\'m not interested in it. I may try it once it becomes available for a decent price, but after 8 years of being vegetarian and vegan, the sight and thought of eating meat is off-putting. I\'m perfectly happy with my food selection (I\'ve only scratched the surface, Indian food is crazy) and nutrition. But some vegans can\'t wait, and that\'s fine. I\'m sure you\'d find many discussions on a search in r/vegan.',
			'Don\'t even need to go full. Just limit meat to a few meals a a week. ',
			'This is 100% my philosophy and it\'s allowed me to be 95% vegetarian/vegan for the past 3 years. The recidivism rate for vegetarians (ie. how often they start eating meat again) is 90-95%, so I am a firm believer that reducing your meat consumption (not eliminating it) is far more effective and sustainable.  Note: it might sound like 95% vegetarian is the same as the 95% of "vegetarians" who return eating meat -- but actually, in the first case, you live an entire life of 5% meat consumption -- whereas the temporary vegetarians go 0% for a year and then back to much higher rates for the rest of their life. So, the 5% meat consumption is far more reductive than the temporary vegetarian approach.',
			'The unfathomable magnitude of suffering we inflict on animals should be enough.',
			'True. I find it fascinating that when people who go vegan for health or environment (which are great reasons too), say it still takes a few years before they fully feel compassionate towards animals, or not unfazed by slaughter footage. Shows just how desensitized people are to it,',
			'ockquote> however, the majority of this food gets fed to livestock while 100 million people are starving to death and 815 million are undernourished.  I just want to point out that we have enough for everyone, already, even with food going to animals. According to the UN, 1/3 of all the world\'s food produced for human consumption is either lost or wasted.  While, yes, this does include people throwing away too much food at home, it also includes businesses throwing away perfectly good food that didn\'t sell, farms leaving perfectly good food on the ground because it doesn\'t meet beauty standards for sale, improper storage leading to food rot, and so on. Just reducing this issue would feed billions.',
			'I\'m scared for the future',
			'some facts about animal agriculture  Ethical issues (disturbing footage, but I would urge you to watch it. Just to give a glimpse at how we treat our fellow beings).. Or any slaughter house footage.. Fossil Fuels  More than a third of all raw materials and fossil fuels consumed in the United States are used in animal production (“Ecological Cooking” by Joanne Stepaniak and Kathy Hecker) The production of one calorie of animal protein requires more than ten times the fossil fuel input as a calorie of plant protein. (The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition) Producing a single hamburger uses enough fuel to drive 20 miles and causes the loss of five times its weight in topsoil. (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins)  Water  Nearly half of all the water used in the United States goes to raising animals for food (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins). It takes more than 2,400 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of meat and only 25 gallons to produce one pound of wheat (“Water Inputs in California Food Production” by Marcia Kreith) To produce a day’s food for one meat-eater takes over 4,000 gallons; for a lacto-ovo vegetarian, only 1200 gallons; for a vegan, only 300 gallons (The Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook) Animals raised for food produce approximately 130 times as much excrement as the entire human population and animal farms pollute our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined. Run-offs of animal waste, pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics are contributing to dead zones in coastal areas, degradation of coral reef and health problems. (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency).  Land  Raising animals for food (including land used for grazing and land used to grow feed crops) now uses a staggering 30% of the Earth’s land mass. (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) Seven football fields’ worth of land is bulldozed every minute to create more room for farmed animals and the crops that feed them. (The Smithsonian Institution) Of all the agricultural land in the U.S., 80% is used to raise animals for food and grow grain to feed them—that’s almost half the total land mass of the lower 48 states (“Major Uses of Land in the United States” by Marlow Vesterby and Kenneth S. Krupa)  Air  The massive amounts of excrement produced by livestock farms emit toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia into the air. Roughly 80% of ammonia emissions in the U.S. come from animal waste (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). When the cesspools holding tons of urine and feces get full, factory farms will frequently get around water pollution limits by spraying liquid manure into the air, creating mists that are carried away by the wind. (“Neighbors of Vast Hog Farms Say Foul Air Endangers Their Health,” by Jennifer Lee, The New York Times 11 May 2003) Air pollutants generated by animal farms can cause respiratory illness, lung inflammation, and increase vulnerability to respiratory diseases, such as asthma. Emissions of reactive organics and ammonia from animal farming can play a role in the formation of ozone (smog) and air pollution (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency)  Food  In the U.S., 70% of the grain grown is fed to animals on feedlots (“Plants, Genes, and Agriculture” by Jones and Bartlet) It takes up to 16 pounds of grain to produce just 1 pound of meat. (The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat by Mark Gold and Jonathon Porritt). Fish on fish farms must be fed 5 pounds of wild-caught fish to produce one pound of farmed fish flesh (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins) The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth (“The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat” by Mark Gold and Jonathon Porritt)  Climate Change  Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide (this is more than all the cars, trucks, planes, and ships in the world combined) (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) Livestock account for an estimated 9% of global CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions, estimated 35-40% of global CH4 (Methane) emissions and 65% of NO2 (Nitrous Oxide) emissions (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) By replacing your “regular car” with a Toyota Prius the average person can prevent the emission of about 1 tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere, By replacing an omnivorous diet with a vegan diet the average person can prevent the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s 50% more CO2 saved! (“It’s better to green your diet than your car”, The New Scientist, December 17, 2005.) In addition to all of the above, let’s not forget that the expansion of livestock farming is one of the key factors leading to deforestation in parts of the world such as Latin America and posing a significant threat of the Earth’s biodiversity. Our Oceans are not being spared either and over-fishing is having a devastating impact on our marine ecosystems. This is not just a problem that impacts our planet, it’s a humanitarian crisis. Our demand for animal based products is diverting precious resources like land, water and fossil fuels to produce farmed animals instead of feeding the estimated billion + people that are malnourished in the world. We can all start working on sustainable alternatives or attempt to make sustainable choices as a solution to this problem, but the easiest solution is the elimination of the demand for animal based products. Switching to a plant-based lifestyle is the only long term solution that not only benefits the environment, but also the animals and our health.  HEALTH  Recent evidence from large prospective US and European cohort studies and from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies indicates that the long-term consumption of increasing amounts of red meat and particularly of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes, in both men and women. The association persists after inclusion of known confounding factors, such as age, race, BMI, history, smoking, blood pressure, lipids, physical activity and multiple nutritional parameters in multivariate analysis. The association has not always been noted with red meat, and it has been absent with white meat. There is evidence of several mechanisms for the observed adverse effects that might be involved, however, their individual role is not defined at present. It is concluded that recommendations for the consumption of unprocessed red meat and particularly of processed red meat should be more restrictive than existing recommendations. Restrictive recommendations should not be applied to subjects above about 70 years of age, as the studies quoted herein did not examine this age group, and the inclusion of sufficient protein supply (e. g. in the form of meat) is particularly important in the elderly. Link to study Processed meat is considered to be any meat which has been modified in order either to improve its taste or to extend its shelf life. Methods of meat processing include salting, curing, fermentation, and smoking. Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by-products such as blood. Processed meat products include bacon, ham, hotdogs, sausages, salami, corned beef, beef jerky, canned meat and meat-based sauces. Meat processing includes all the processes that change fresh meat with the exception of simple mechanical processes such as cutting, grinding or mixing. IARC at the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as a Group 1, carcinogenic to humans, since it has found sufficient evidence that consumption of processed meat by humans causes colorectal cancer.  WORLD HUNGER  Instead of using our resources in the most energy-efficient way possible by growing plants to feed directly to people, we currently use our dwindling land and water to grow grain to then feed to animals who we then eat, giving us considerably less bang for our resource “buck.” By some estimates, we could feed 1.4 billion additional people simply by giving up beef, pork, and poultry in the United States. Think of what we could do if the entire world gave up all animal products!  HUMAN COST   NY Times Article Many reports of humans suffering in the Animal Ag industry.. It\'s a PDF, only some of the links here are relevant   ',
			'Well shit now I see what vegetarians are getting at...',
			'Vegans, moreso. As crazy as it may sound to adapt to a plant based diet, it is absolutely essential to halt climate change and deforestation, as well as being far more cost efficient on the global scale and thus greatly affecting those suffering from world hunger: vegans care about a whole lot more than just the welfare of the animals themselves',
			'vegans* Supporting the dairy and egg industry is bad, yo. (And other animal products.)',
			'Not nearly as bad at all. And it\'s much easier to get some to consider not eating meat and changing their lifestyle if they can take baby steps and can still eat cheese and pizza. Going cold turkey vegan without any knowledge of vegan food is what people do then a weekend later say it\'s impossible and go back to full meat.',
			'Its not that the information isn\'t there. Its that people choose to ignore it and the government continues to subsidize it.',
			'I can think of several people I have the misfortune of knowing who would reply to /u/varun_pcg informative post with a "hurr durr, I like bacon."',
			'Ehh. It\'s just the internet being the internet. But there is some good here, since those kind of ppl are facing an internal conflict with themselves (cognitive dissonance) and are expressing themselves in that particular manner. Those ppl are more likely to change than those who don\'t express their dissonance. (Then there are some who are plain arrogant and silly)',
			'Honestly you say it\'s the internet but majority of people you\'d meet especially from my own experience as being vegan will reply with a similar answer. My favourite is "but what about steak?!" ^',
			'Thank you.',
			'I really need to stop eating meat. I keep saying I will but then I don\'t end up following through. It makes me feel terrible. I just need to do it',
			'You can start by reducing! It doesn\'t have to be all or nothing. Just start picking days of the week to be meat free.',
			'Start small! Very few people succeed with cold turkey habit changes. I suggest looking up No Meat Athlete podcast which has some tips on habit change , plus Thought for Food for the why and how to go plant based. ',
			'You can do it. r/vegan can be a big help.',
			'Amen! Thank you. People want to be horrified about the destruction of the Amazon while at the same time dance around the reason for all the destruction.',
			'Right. When this says "corn and soy" it sounds like veg is to blame. ',
			'This is so true. The overwhelming majority of this land is being used to grow genetically-modified corn and soy to be used exclusively for cattle feed. ',
			'ockquote> genetically-modified corn  So, corn.',
			'If you put genetically-modified in front, it makes it sound much more like something I should hate.',
			'genetically-modified socks',
			'Which is a shame, because GMOs are absolutely one answer to world hunger when and if implemented correctly (See: Golden rice and modern day corn.) It\'s fine to be against poor implementations of GMOs in agriculture, but to be against the concept is to be against things we depend on such as vaccines and insulin. ',
			'We must all remember to be outraged at the dumb hippies and their unscientific prejudice against GMOs. That\'s what\'s important here.',
			'It is pretty dumb to use an environmental argument for reducing meat but then not want to modify plants to best meet demand. Can certainly be against the practices of those that modify the crop or farming practices used by those that farm corn and soy but modifying crops to produce more and better food is a good thing. Look at modified wheat saving who knows how many millions of lives.',
			'Why do you have to say GMOs, as your just adfing to the fear mongering on something that could help solve hunger caused by agricultural ineffecienties.',
			'Right. Whether or not the crops are genetically modified is not relevant to the fact that they just burned down a rainforest to plant said crops, which they intend to feed to cattle. He just added GMO because it "sounds scary."',
			'I mean, they\'d need more land if they were growing non-GMO corn, so specifying it really doesn\'t help your argument',
			'What an outrage, I say we destroy the planet with non-GMO corn the way god intended. ',
			'They clear land for cattle and others too.',
			'Also, soy and corn is the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world\'s beef. It\'s okay though, it\'s not like we need a forest that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.',
			'Argentina is actually a larger producer of soymeal which is what feeds livestock. They’ve had moisture issues recently which is what drove the the recent rally in soybean meal futures this year. ',
			'With all that pampas I\'m surprised they need to. I guess maybe it\'s a Norway situation, they export a lot of soy for animal feed and don\'t use much of it themselves.',
			'Yes, this is detailed in the article - a lot of cattle ranches',
			'By not mentioning livestock your title seems to redirect blame at the people doing the least harm. Livestock consumes more corn and soy than people by a factor of 5.',
			'The unfortunate truth is that the Amazon rainforest will never be as profitable as growing corn and beef. ',
			'If we really, truly care about the Amazon rainforest, the best we can do as consumers is to make it less profitable: eat less beef.  Cutting out the middle-cow and eating the grain and soy directly gets us ten times the efficiency. With 1/10th the need for cultivated ground, we won\'t need to deforest any more of it.',
			'Or their government can start enforcing laws and kick the shit out of anyone in violation.',
			'I\'m cynical enough that I don\'t trust my government to pave a road or even go after the guy burning tires down the street. Vote with your dollar. When lobbying and corruption are insurmountable, the best way you can get someone to stop doing something is to stop paying them to do it!',
			'Why not both? I mean, you realize that with just those laws in place, we would suddenly have less access to beef, so it forces our hand to live as a more vegetarian society.',
			'Its about millions and millions of Chinese who for the first time can afford meat in their daily diet -combined with impoverished inner Brazil where land and labor are cheap and infrastructure investment allows the crop to be moved out. How to tell the Chinese they can\'t eat affordable protein (soy fed) and the Brazilians they can\'t bring economic growth to inner parts of the country? No clear answers.',
			'Americans eat the most meat per capita of any country. Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_meat_consumption',
			'Don\'t blame the Chinese. Europe and America eat more beef than them. Just because their market is growing doesn\'t mean it isn\'t our problem aswell. We need to stop the growth and stop the west from eating it.',
			'It is. The problem is, that profit is given to the whole of mankind, not a handful of corporate pockets.',
			'And livestock feed',
			'Mostly livestock feed.',
			'Why isn\'t multi level farming a big thing yet? We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. ',
			'I have worked on a multi-level farm. It is more efficient in some ways, but still a ton of waste. The power costs are huge, and at least at the farm I worked on we were throwing away about probably 30-40% of every harvest due to mold or bugs.',
			'ockquote> multi-level farming.  Is this a pyramid scheme?',
			'Aw, that joke deserves at least one upvote. Have one.',
			'You can use biodigesters to create BioGas out of rotting food. ',
			'But would the chemistry of plant matetial waste make for a stable/usable substrate (mostly on its own)? There\'s no doubt that if it pencils out it would beat letting the material decompose in the open air, but I\'m sure composting could be a good path too. I\'m hoping to build my own home-scale digester this year. It\'s a really cool way to make something of food waste if you have the patience to sustain the project!',
			'Depends on the input and scale. Setting up and operating a digester on a commercial scale requires significant investment. For the food manufacturing companies I work for, we rarely commit capital unless it is required by changing law/regulation, it significantly impacts safety/risk in the plant, or generates a return on investment less than 2.5 years. I can\'t even get solar power projects covered and we spend nearly $1M in electricity a quarter. The issue with those is the "solar" installers charge a fortune here, or they get pushy with long term maintenance agreements(20 years+). Local building code requires a specific license, and they are like the mob I swear. We priced the same size array for sites across the country, our site cost was double the rest, and i am fully capable of maintaining these systems with my own maintenance crew. With the high price ROI was 11 years so no go. ',
			'Well that\'s unfortunate. I had always had a great deal of hope in the potential for those.',
			'No reason not to have hope, it is a new concept that I am sure can be made more efficient. It is one possible solution to a multi-faceted problem.',
			'You\'re right. We should endeavour to make this \'hope\' process more efficient and maybe it could become a common sight around tge world.',
			'You\'re right. If we even did 50% of the farming that way, you can bet your ass it would be way more efficient. ',
			'Half the crop is usable and the other half goes to feed Fungus and Insects! Win/Win!',
			'Why is there so much more fungus/insects or whatever on multi-level farms?',
			'Ok so its not quite there yet .it seems like those problems could be ironed out with innovation money and time.',
			'The huge power consumption is bound by physics. The sun provides 1360 W/m2 of light. To replicate the amount of light the sun provides will always require lots of power.',
			'Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.',
			'Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can\'t beat the set-up cost.',
			'It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it. Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.',
			'As far as I gather it\'s the cost of electricity holding them back. Multi level farming essentially cuts down on land area and water use, but massively increases electricity use. In most places land area and water cost are negligible, but electricity cost is not. So massively increasing efficiency in things which are very cheap isn\'t very helpful (for now anyway). If the economics of land/water change, and/or electricity gets much cheaper (and maybe AI can make them further automated) then things will likely change. Solar power should be less than half the price (greater than 50% price reduction) by 2030. And AI will be enormously more sophisticated by then too. Also another factor would be the pink LED lighting they use. I doubt they\'re as efficient as they can be. Easily within 10 years I\'d have thought we\'ll have micro-LED arrays and/or electroluminescent quantum dot lighting, which could be more precisely tuned and also more efficient in general (as in lumens per watt). And every % increase in electrical efficiency is going to be a significant overall cost reduction. So it wouldn\'t surprise me if sometime between late 2020s-early 2030s they become more economical than normal farms, and/or become a way for small-scale personal farms to make money.',
			'The lighting we use now is pretty good. When you see purple it is because they are hitting the red and blue spectrum that the plant needs most and we can fit our light levels pretty close to the photosynthetically active range.',
			'LEDs in general are very good by previous standards, sure. I\'m just assuming as this is a new use for them, and there hasn\'t been real demand for red&blue mixed LEDs before, there\'s still room for improvement. And, as far as I gather, the lighting electricity cost is a large % of the costs? So if you could say halve the electricity use of the lighting, that would be quite significant?',
			'You would still be competing against people who are just using big empty fields, which will always be simpler and cheaper',
			'The sun is free energy that plants absorb and convert into products we want. Indoor, multi-level farms take external power, convert it at low efficiency to light to make plants grow. The only reason there is so much interest in these setups is the huge profit margins they created in marijuana farming. If you grow something where the whole plant can be consumed, like salad greens, and charge a premium it can make sense, for everything else it is a huge waste. Even with salad greens it is a huge waste, but premium prices based on novelty can make it profitable.',

			'How do we stop this?',
			'Most of the world\'s soy is used to feed less livestock. So eat less animal products.',
			'This. One thing about life is that most of the energy an animal gets from food is released as heat. This means that it takes more calories to make meat then you get from eating it. So it\'s almost like throwing away perfectly fine food so we can get the "tastier" meat :/',
			'It takes more calories to make anything then you get from it, plants included. It\'s kind of a Newtonian law.',
			'Well, yeah, there\'s no beating the laws of thermodynamics. But animal agriculture is particularly egregious. It takes somewhere around 10 grain calories to make 1 calorie of meat, all things considered.  Why not eat the soy and grain directly? If I could improve the efficiency of a process by tenfold, I\'d jump all over it.',

Unless we pay them to preserve it for us (and for us most of what we want it for is tourism and some science, let’s be honest) they will do what they need to survive and thrive, just as we did when we destroyed our forests The reason it’s the last great one is that we already profited from doing this to ours long ago',

Environmental disaster would result if we didn\'t stop it.  And now, five decades later, it\'s all coming true. There are almost 8 billion. The weather is changing. The sea is filled with plastic. The fish and sea mammals are depleted. The oceans are overheating. The coral reefs are collapsing. The rain forests are almost gone. All wildlife now live in large reservations, and even so they will be inevitably wiped out to keep China supplied with tiger penises, bear bile, elephant tusk and rhino horn. Species are facing extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing. To young people today....I\'m so sorry. We knew it was coming, but we failed. You will have to live with whatever apocalypse results from our mismanagement. We leave you the worst imaginable legacy: a dying planet.',
			'Environmental Pressure = Population x Footprint  Pointing at population is important and there are already very meaningful projects to reduce the fertility rate in developing nations which should only be encouraged more. But that\'s still only looking at half the picture. Eating meat for example, greatly increases your footprint. Cutting down on meat consumption is hands down the biggest thing people can do to reduce the burden they put on the planetary resources. ',

We\'d have to abolish almost every single government on the planet and replace them with sensible people who actually listen to the scientists and DO something instead of letting our planet die.

There was a increase in the last 2 years, yes, but the level of devastation is nowhere near what it once was and analyze the deforestation using data from only the last 2 years is just wrong. We need to analyze decades, not 1/2 years. Deforestation has been falling and it will continue to fall in the next few decades. Edit: Actually deforestation has been going down as a whole, but burning of the forest has increased. That sucks, of course, but overall, deforestation is still falling, even if one specific form of deforestation has gone up',
			'There\'s also less of the forest left to cut down. Declining rates of deforestation is good, but the fact that there is still significant amounts if forest being cleared is troubling.',

If you do that enough over the span of a week or two you’re going to have the opportunity to dictate what people are seeing first on Twitter at a crucial point in the election without needing to pour millions of dollars into sophisticated equipment and programs like some kind of spy movie. I think you’re absolutely kidding yourself if you don’t think Russia (and other countries) constantly do this and use other creative means to influence policy and public opinion in other countries.

It hits the notifications of 10 followers of those 50 retweets. Suddenly 500 people have seen it. If those numbers hold, 500,000 retweets could hit 1-5 million twitter accounts. Now let’s look at how close this election was: Trump got ~63,000,000 votes in 2016 (~3,000,000 less than Clinton). 1,000,000 voters makes a huge difference.  But what if the effort was run with some specific targets? We know that the Trump bots on Facebook were claimed to be targeted more at a demographic in Michigan. So what if twitter bots were as well? There Trump won by ~11,000 votes, with ~5,000,000 votes cast. So if they influenced 0.4% of Michigan voters to vote Trump, not vote Hillary, or both...then there’s an easy example of how 500,000 twitter followers can easily change the election.',

			'Casting a wide net: We took a similarly expansive approach to defining what qualifies as a Russian-linked account. Because there is no single characteristic that reliably determines geographic origin or affiliation, we relied on a number of criteria, such as:   whether the account was created in Russia, whether the user had a Russian phone carrier  or a Russian email address associated with the account,  whether the user’s display name contains a significant number of Cyrillic characters, and whether the user has logged in from any Russian IP address, even a single time.   We considered an account to be Russian-linked if it had even one of the relevant criteria.  But "what about non-Russian people using Russian VPN\'s?" I hear you ask. Twitter know thats a problem, but they dont care, still lump \'em in with "Russian hackers" anyway: "we observed that a high concentration of automated egagement and content originated from data centers and users accessing Twitter via Virtual Private Networks (“VPNs”) and proxy servers. In fact, based on our analysis at the time of the hearing, nearly 12% of Tweets created during the election originated with accounts that had a masked/indeterminate location on the day they were posted." https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Edgett%20Appendix%20to%20Responses.pdf TL;DR Twitter have no fucking idea who is Russian or not.

It takes some effort to even find a Russian VPN, most common VPN services do not offer servers in Russia for a reason. The number of these people outside of Russia using Russian VPN\'s is staggeringly low, to the point of being utterly irrelevant.',
			'ockquote> If this is the best you\'ve got  Not my personal argument, I\'ve never used a VPN. But its a common rebuttal that comes up in many threads regarding twitter identification of "Russians" so it is worth examining. Its an argument so common that I\'m not going to delete the sentences I added just because you dont like them. Edit   It takes some effort to even find a Russian VPN  I did a google search for "Russian VPN" and this was the fourth result on the first page. Not much effort. https://www.le-vpn.com/vpn-russia/ If you’re travelling abroad, you can use a local IP for the best connection, or you can switch to a Russian IP to keep up to date with the latest news, sports and entertainment on NTV, TNT and other Russian television station websites.',
			'That\'s a good point. Twitter set a very, very high bar in terms of how they determined what was a Russian bot.

			'ockquote> So what is the correlation between retweets and votes?  I don\'t even think something like that is measurable without gross violations of peoples privacy. Which is part of the problem. We see a massive misinformation campaign from Russia aimed to benefit trump. But it is damn near impossible to measure it\'s actual effects. It could have been the sole decider of the election, or it could have done literally nothing. We have no real way to tell. All we can do is attempt to stop it from happening again, though of course republicans seem to be banking of Russia helping them out in this years elections too.',
			'I think you\'re asking the wrong questions here. Trying to measure direct impact from something like this is not only difficult but doesn\'t really solve a problem. Consider these: Given that Russia purposefully disseminated misinformation to influence the US presidential election, what areas or populations in the US are most vulnerable? In what ways does our current tech. policy facilitate or stymie such campaigns? How do we better protect ourselves from targeted propaganda in the future? How can we detect such campaigns in the future? And sadly: how do we actually convince American citizens that yes, Russia ran propaganda campaigns, and that yes, it matters deeply?',
			'Well, if most of them were targeted directly at rural Pennsylvania/Michigan/Wisconsin lower class/working poor people, it could well have swayed enough votes; those were the key battleground states this time around, and Trump only won them (and their electoral college votes) by very slim margins.',
			'Weren\'t lower working class or poor people kind of Trumps demographic anyway though? ',

			'I guess my question would then be, what percentage of that demographic are Twitter users. "lower class/working poor" doesn\'t scream Twitter to me. I don\'t doubt Russia tried to get involved in the election... And maybe Trump conspired with them (the evidence is still fairly light, but if it\'s proven I\'ll all for impeachment) but I just don\'t think it ultimately changed the outcome.',
			'They were targeted to very specific areas. In the broader sense it definitely swing votes to Trump, but in those swing states that were allegedly targeted in had a big impact.  That\'s where Kushner, Cambridge Analytica and Robert Mercer come into the picture.  That\'s also where Jill Stein comes into the picture. It\'s been reported that in the last days of the election she focused her time and money in those same swing states. That made no sense for the Green Party, because if Stein wanted federal funds she needed to get the most votes possible in the states most friendly towards her.  That\'s where it gets interesting. Because from a strategic point of view, the Green Party and Stein are going to siphon off far more votes from the Democrats than Trump. If you\'re trying to take votes away from Hillary Clinton in the last weeks of an election, getting the Green Party to campaign in those swing states is very damaging to Clinton. ',

Once people have stuck with one viewpoint for a long time, they have an even harder time adjusting their views because it means admitting how they were wrong in the past.

Very few people have the mental fortitude and drive to sort through the truth on their own for every single topic, so sometimes people just accept what ever idea is the easiest to accept.

All time and effort spent on fact checking ( a ton if done throughly) is time and effort not put in another area of someone’s life.

Russia is in the limelight because they are both a) effective and b) brazen users of these new and emerging methods for influencing public opinion.',
			'I disagree with the notion that we should overlook these organizations as not a huge danger, because they are nominally allied with the US or believe that they are working in the United States best interests. I actually think entities ran by entities in America are potentially more dangerous then the Russians, because their interests are central to the US and almost by definition involve changing US opinion. Russia, on the other hand, while adversarial, is concerned with matters that are not as central to the United States(i.e getting NATO out of Ukraine, ME political interests). This point is arguable, but I really don\'t think we should be treating these powerful entities as even slightly benign.  I also disagree that Russia has been particularly effective, more effective then CTR perhaps, but I see no evidence why it is that much more effective then anywhere else. If it was so powerful, why are threads like this up-voted enormously every day? I know that up-votes aren\'t the end of the story, but it seems to me like the popular opinion on social media is very firmly against Russia.  Also in terms of overall influence from a foreign country, Russia pails in comparison to Israel. Israel aside from its shills, has powerful political organizations, connections and extremely rich donors that are almost exclusively focused on Israeli interests within the United States, advantages which Russia lacks almost entirely. Also their was some discussion of Cambridge Analytica, but that was seen as being on the "same side" as the russian trolls, and even sometimes implied as being part of the same operation. ',

There are stories about Russian bots literally almost every day, Twitter and Facebook are freaking out and people are being accused of being Russian shills constantly, but no one mentions that Russia is only one of the many entities that are doing this.  I hate the "what about this" mentality as well, but the level of attention on Russia is such that people are getting an extremely inaccurate picture of the entire situation. ',
			'Interesting use of "whataboutism".',
			'Because they\'re just more comfortable going back to the Russian boogeyman. Doesn\'t matter that their own politicians are corrupt, more of the " he\'s an idiot, but he is our idiot," sort of mentality. All that money to Israel,and for what? The alliance with them isnt worth much, what does America actually gain out of it ?  People don\'t want to admit America support for Israel is not because they benefit in anyway,it\'s just because the Israelis lobby is so strong that they can\'t take a piss if Israel doesn\'t nod their head.

She was never going to win, and the DNC should have known that. However they choose to ignore reality, and push Hilary over Bernie.

These people are already very gullible, and once they buy disinformation like this they just become even more credulous. Trump exploited this and took advantage of people that just don\'t know any better. The GOP has been cultivating this for years. They made half the country ripe for the picking for a crazy moron like Trump and very vulnerable to disinformation campaigns by our enemies. There\'s a reason the first thing authoritarians do is attack the legitimacy of the media.',
			'ockquote> These people are already very gullible  Some of them definitely are, but even educated democrats and republicans have fallen for fake news, too. I think the larger force at work here is confirmation bias, and the fact that we as a species hate being corrected.

Think of America, think of how fundamentally different the experiences of someone are who grows up let\'s say Chicago, Brooklyn, L.A., vs. Someone who grows up in a tiny 1,000 population town. They\'re just completely different, but at least in the u.s. have programs that ensure no matter how rural you are you have access to information. Afghanistan is still tribal in a lot of territory. Those are the areas the Taliban gets support from. People that have basically no idea what\'s going on. And by the time anyone in the Taliban maybe realizes "oh we\'re doing some crazy bullshit." They kinda can\'t leave, and if you have no education it\'s a lot easier to believe Taliban propaganda. My favorite one I heard from a military buddy that served in Afghanistan is he and a group of marines were going through a town in the middle of nowhere and they asked why everyone was afraid of them, the local village elder said that he knew that in America to become a marine you need to eat a baby. Like that\'s just \'common knowledge\' in some areas.',

They are more aware now of what is going on in their surroundings but just 10 years ago most of them didn\'t even know they were in a country called Afghanistan and may have not even have heard of it. They all grew up in mud and stone houses and have never been anything other than poor, uneducated and oblivious to world affairs. Then one day these dudes with AKs show up in army fatigues and say they can give what they would consider a small fortune to take this jacket, put it on and go stand in a market or take this car and drive it near that building and when you get back we will pay you. If you have spent your whole life eating what amounts to garbage in the first world and you don\'t know who jihadis are you would most likely take them up on their offer without even suspecting a damn thing. Then you take the package or vehicle or whatever they want to the place they say and boom, they blow your ass up with a remote IED. I know that isn\'t the case in the bombing today but I just want to illustrate that these bombings and shit make absolutely no sense to us but that is because we have a perspective that is simply unavailable to them. Jihadis will do some crazy heinous shit then blame it on who ever they want and there are lots of people there who will believe them and then join them to fight who they think are the perpetrators.

A few paved roads and written languages aren\'t going to undo that in only a 100 years or so.  Roddy McDowall had an interesting observation from the set of the original Planet of the Apes movie. He said that in the lunchroom when people were out of costume, they grouped together to eat according to their race. Later, when they were in costume, they all grouped together based on their costumes. All the chimps ate together, all the gorillas, orangutans, etc. He also said that it must simply be part of human nature to want to be around people from our own groups. IMO, it only becomes a problem when we use it as a reason to hate each other or exclude each other. Is it a form of bigotry if I enjoy hanging out with stoners more than other groups?',
			'It\'s not necessarily bigotry, but I think it\'s important to be aware of in-group/outgroup bias. We have a tendency to assume that people in our own groups are more similar to us than they actually are, and that people outside of it are more different than they actually are. Sports is an excellent example of this -- if you identify as a devout fan of a sports team, you feel a strong sense of similitude with the fans of your team, and distance yourself and feel different from fans of other teams. In reality, it\'s a really arbitrary way of grouping, and aside from geographical/regional differences, you\'re often not any more similar to the people you associate with because you share a common group than the people you don\'t. This has been explored at length in studies where subjects were asked how much kinship they felt to completely arbitrary groups that they were placed into strangers with. TL;DR: It\'s natural to find comfort in being a part of a group, but recognize this kind of mental distortion and try to check yourself when you make assumptions about the people outside of your groups.',

To be fair I think if this happened in most peaceful African countries most people would have not really thought about the attack for more than a day. Again, that\'s a matter of proximity.  I\'m sure the outpouring of support and flag filters for Paris was much more common in Europe and the Americas, followed at a distance by Africa and MENA, but probably not that important in East or South Asia Asia. I\'m surprised nobody made a study on where the Facebook users who used that flag filter were located.  I think its normal to be more interested in events that happen nearby than ones far away. There\'s no shame in it.  Though, I also must say there was some bizarre silence around the downing of the Malaysia airlines in Ukraine, with mainly Dutch passengers, and, I think before or after, the downing of a Metrojet flight in Egypt with mainly Russian passengers.

(can\'t remember the exact place) But anyway he was a great guy but he had ptsd terrible paranoia from what he had seen and dealt with, He told me one of the worst things he personally had to do was to shoot up an ambulance that wouldn\'t stop. He said the ambulance ended up having innocent people trying to save someones life, and they ended up killing everyone inside because they couldn\'t risk a massive bomb flying thru the checkpoint in disguise. I honestly can\'t judge him, in that situation it\'s do or die and split second decisions cause lives to be lost. EDIT: I think he did the right thing, he said they made it VERY clear that the ambulance needed to stop while it was at a distance and they kept coming without signs of slowing, at which point it becomes a guessing game of "is it going to be me and everyone with me, or them that die?"',

There was a man out the window raising his hand and waving out the window. He said he had something in his hand and did not know what. They shot at the building with a tank and killed a bunch of people. The guy was apparently trying to wave to show that we\'re no hostiles in building. Everyone who died was innocent.

Turned into pretty bad ptsd. Years later he\'s doing better because of friends and family (and possibly a good MDMA hook up for a couple years.) Anyway, we found out that what finally snapped him was when he had to take out a truck that was flying towards a checkpoint. He saw the little girls in the front seat. He waited until he couldn\'t anymore and opened fire and they blew up. I tried to tell him he didn\'t kill the girls and they were dead the second they were put on the truck and he was saving his brothers rather than killing those kids. He\'s a bit more open about it now and he agrees, but you can tell it doesn\'t really help just knowing he did the right thing, and that\'s after years of getting drunk and bawling his eyes out to me all night. Years of being suicidal. And that\'s just how it affected one guy I know when nobody that either of us knew was killed. Shit is fucked up.',

At one point, she was asked by the resistance to bring her bike, which now had a flat tire courtesy of the Resistance, up to a Nazi camp and ask the soldiers to let her keep her bike there while she ran down the street to get a patch to fix her tire. The soldiers told her that would be fine, she leaned her bike up against one of their trucks (filled with munitions), and ran like hell. 10 seconds later, there was a massive explosion from the basket on her bike, which ignited the munitions in the truck, destroying everything in the immediate vicinity of that Nazi camp. It’s quite an awesome story to hear. The point being, giving bombs to children is nothing new, nothing isolated to the Taliban or ISIS, and it’s quite an effective means for terrorist organizations, like the Belgian Resistance, to attack their enemies.

The reality is that the condition of our hospitals & clinics are poor and many of the people admitted will likely succumb to their wounds.  There\'s a palpable sense of frustration in Kabul toward the current administration. Essentially, Ashraf Ghani was elected on a mandate of ridding the gov\'t of corruption and bringing a lasting peace deal. Neither of these things have materialized. He\'s found it very difficult to purge his government of warlords (a bit difficult when you choose a war criminal like Dostum as your VP) and the patronage network assembled under the Karzai administration. The Taliban launch these attacks to show they\'re still alive and kicking. The fact that they\'re capable of launching several attacks in the capital is a security and intelligence failure, and I believe this will sink Ghani in the next election.

		ments: [
			'Hey, wonderful, this is just fantastic...said no one in the west anywhere ever.',
			'Things were going to well and there were no missile tests lately so they had to spice things up. ',
			'surely it\'s the unilateral sanctions that\'s spicing anything up?',
			'Russia isn\'t exactly on great terms with the US. Russia itself is being targeted by US sanctions, why would they cooperate with the US when it doesn\'t benefit them at all?',
			'Why not. The US cant go killing millions of people everytime they want a regime change.',
			'Russia needs whatever money they can get, and they\'ll get it from whoever they can get it from. They see the sanctions as an opportunity to be the only supplier and get all the profit.',
			'Yes, all that ~40-50 million usd profits! North Korea doesn\'t trade enough (all countries added up) that would be worth the bother.  I haven\'t really looked into what the sanctions are, but here are a few things to consider:  Current amount of oil that Russia sells to North Korea would last Luxemburg a day or two. They sell around 250 000 barrels per year to them. You can do the calculations yourself... And we are talking about a country with a vast arsenal of weapons and I think around 20 million people. EDIT: Sorry, I was wrong. It would last them a whole 4 days!   Slight note on the above. Luxemburg, with a population of just over half a million, consumes 3.5 times more oil daily than North Korea, with a population of 25 million people. They consume about 17 000 bbl/day, so Russian exports to them would last them... 14 days! Nearly half a month! Terrible, right?  Why would Russia even agree to sanction ANYONE on behalf of the United States, when the terms are mostly dictated by the former and the US, at the same time, is sanctioning Russia as well. If North Korea goes nuclear or there is some trouble there, there are only a few scenarios that could play out in the region: 1) South Korea takes over North Korea and later on in time you see US military bases (or US supported) popping up right next to the coast of Russia and one of their biggest ports. 2) China takes control of the entire peninsula. You might think that the former would be beneficial to Russia, but that would mean war on the peninsula, very close to Russia\'s borders. They don\'t want that happening.  Keep in mind that these are the only three points that I can think up right now, there are probably more diplomatic stuff going into the entire deal, such as China being forced into participating in a conflict if it\'s started by someone other than North Korea. Russia might also be doing this purely out of precedence. They don\'t want the United States to keep switching regimes all over the world as they might just decide one day to do the same to Russia. Not to mention that the US has already renegated on deals made on North Korea, so agreeing to these sanctions unchecked would just lead to further ones as the US would not like the way things are going and decide to change them again, lol.

The only reason Putin is going against US sanctions is because NK is a trading partner with Russia and it\'s another thorn to stick in America\'s side.',

			'We have sanctions on Russia (or should but Trump must have forgot to implement them), so Putin will never agree to NK sanctions.  Putin really dislikes the sanctions put on Russia by Obama as the sanctions were targeted at Putin/Russia AND his oligarchs. Putin and his rise to power was in part milking oligarchs one by one by requiring 50% of their wealth to not be locked up and using their cash otherwise he would leverage, arrest or discard them  Browder, it should be recalled, was the founder and CEO of Hermitage Capital Management, a hedge fund that did business in Russia and that was looted of $230 million by kleptocrats allied with Vladimir Putin in the largest case of tax fraud in Russian history. Browder and his firm were hauled into court by the Putin regime on a number of trumped-up charges. Some of his lawyers and associates were beaten in the streets. The company lawyer who discovered the massive pillaging was a guy named Sergei Magnitsky, and he was arrested and "died in custody," that all-purpose fig-leaf used by corrupt cops from Moscow to Bagram to Homan Square in Chicago. (Later, the lawyer who was looking into Magnitsky\'s death got tossed out a fourth floor window.) In response, in 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, which prohibited anyone who was suspected of being involved in Magnitsky\'s death from entering the United States and, more important, denied them the use of any American bank. In response, Putin cut off the adoption of Russian children by American families. And that was the mildest of his response. Behind the scenes, Putin went completely wild. Browder came to the hearing with two extremely large bodyguards, and with quite a tale to tell. ',

I don\'t think countries willingly let things just go. Either way if Russia wants to be a punk and fund NK. I\'m pretty sure they helped out with missile technology as well. Then maybe they\'re Ukraine needs a little bit more military resupply as you said it\'s just Ukraine versus Ukraine right?',
			'Who\'s to blame? Malaysian airlines for taking a flight through a warzone, or the Ukrainian authorities for keeping the airspace open for civilian airlines? No let\'s blame the soldiers who are tired of watching ukrianian airplanes drop bombs on civilians everyday.  And whats more reasonable, telling the majority of the population to leave or the minority? If patriotic Ukrainians were the majority in Donetsk, don\'t you think this rebel stronghold would break after so many years?  You know why there\'s no Ukrainian flags being flown in Donetsk? Not because it\'s illegal to have, but because the locals would claw them.  US has been funding the New Ukrainian government since the beginning, since the bloody revolution in the capital of Kiev. Nothing will change, if US money didn\'t win the war yet then it\'s already lost. ',

And there\'s no Russian troops there right? So it\'s great that you care but I think we\'ll let the ukrainians handle it. Or you know Russia can stop supporting North Korea. Otherwise I say ship the Ukraine a crap ton of weapons. ',

The US is shipping tons of weapons, and that\'s the problem. Might not be a problem for us, sitting on our computer desks.. but atleast try to have the humanity to imagine the receiving end of these weapons.  The US has its destabilizing campaigns in Eastern Europe the same way it has in the middle East. The FSA is funded by US weapons, are they successful? Nope.

			'Because he has very little support outside of younger generations in urban areas. Even in that demographic he is considerably less popular than Putin. Killing him is counter productive. He\'s also pissed off a lot of lower level officials and every Muslim in Russia, so his life is definitely at risk.',
			'having him around actually gives Putin more legitimacy as there\'s an "opposition" to him.  Navalny is pretty irrelevant in Russian politics. Western media publishes more of his statements for controversy but even they know he will never be a legitimate threat to Putin.',
			'He is absolutely key to Putin\'s continued untested power going forward. The moment Putin doesn\'t have any opposition (even if illusionary), the international view starts to change as Putin could now be labelled as a dictator. The illusion of democracy is key. I don\'t think Putin would allow anyone to touch him. He is harmless and no matter how much \'proof\' he gives, it won\'t matter and we all know it.',
			'Not harmless. Think you meant to say untouchable. But I do support your opinion.',
			'What\'s wrong with harmless? Navalny is harmless, as in he can\'t do anything to harm Putin. There is nothing wrong with the sentence.',

			'I suppose by "harmless" /u/agisten thought you were trying to say "unharmable" or something along those lines.',
			'If that were true, he would be allowed to run for president and not restricted by a false criminal conviction. If Putin wanted to use him to demonstrate legitimacy, he’s not doing it very well. I suspect he has more support than the polls suggest, either because they are fake or because few will speak their mind honestly out of fear. He also asks too many uncomfortable questions about the power structure and its endemic corruption that Putin would rather not gain more press. Imagine if there was a debate and Navalny asked Putin where he got the money to build his fancy dachas, and Putin didn’t have a quick retort. It’s one thing when it’s just accusations on YouTube. It’s another when it’s on national television. ',
			'He actually is quite popular. His views are somewhat retrograde for an actual liberal of, say, Nordic inclination, and the moment there are actual free elections - without Putin - in Russia I\'ll vote against Navalny, but it seems like he\'s our one ticket into a somewhat-democratic future, for now. There no one in the Russian politics these days who would work harder and have more ability to actually get there than him. If / when he does get the power, a couple presidential terms will probably corrupt his ability to listen to reason, but he will probably be great for at least his first time. One of his selling points is that he\'ll keep elections free and open, too, which is something anyone would say, but what can you do. He\'s a mixed bag, but exchanging Putin for him would be very welcome, indeed.',
			'What opposition leader has wide support in Russia? Bots like to say how little and insignificant opposition leaders are.

Tunisian military was displeased with the regime, and so down it went. A protest of the common people can only do so much. ',
			'wtf? Russian GDP and average salaries have fucking skyrocketed since Putin took over. Nobody on reddit is old or educated enough to know what Russia was BEFORE Putin, and how much he\'s improved it. Yes he\'s corrupt, but up until him, Russia was corrupt AND poor. Now they\'re corrupt and a lot better off. Many people likely know/suspect the corruption is going on because that is literally all Russia has known in the entirety of its history. The "Russian regime" (lol) won\'t collapse. I don\'t know why I bother with reading these comments about Russia on reddit, everyone comes in swinging with their almighty American high school education and minimal knowledge of world history and it spikes my blood pressure.',
			'Check out GDP per capita growth, like in this graphic, at the end. The last map is from 1990 to 2015.  Russia\'s performance is very bad compared to most Eastern European countries and many of them had 90s just as bad as Russia\'s or worse.  Not to mention that Russia is swimming in oil unlike those others countries. Putin\'s reign over Russia has also coincided with the period of the highest prices of oil even when adjusted for inflation. It\'s hardly a surprise Russia grew compared to the hole it had dug itself in, that was just a bounce back aided by the most fortunate oil prices.  So even though he made Russia better what he did was a failure compared to peers or Russia\'s potential.',

The only issue really is that these are platforms that are often taken by dictators to grow public opinion support, whilst their practical policies are extremely hazardous or right wing.  It\'s kind of a general problem, especially with places like the US where politicians are cartoons of their sides support. A US politician with very neo conservative, confrontational nationalist views but with neo Bernie Sanders styled social and internal platforms are almost a thing of fantasy.  I mean it\'s not just limited to the US, but they make a good example of how radical nationalist can be supported by just making moralist speeches.  But then again, in the UK we have a massive chunk of the population in support of Corbyn, even though he was arguably anti EU for many of his years.

		ments: [
			'To put it in some sort of perspective, it takes about 10,000 times as much energy to warm a cubic meter of water compared to that needed to warm a cubic meter of dry air by a degree. So the vast majority of energy going into global warming is going into the oceans, where it will reemerge in the forms of bigger and stronger storms, and smaller ice caps.',
			'Adding to this most people don\'t realize ocean level rise is predominantly thermal expansion as opposed to ice melt, the bad news is this relationship is cubic',
			'Your link labeled "quadratic" clearly says "cubic fit"',
			'The other problem is that melting ice is a positive feedback loop. As the reflective ice melts, less energy is being reflected back into the atmosphere, and goes straight into the ocean, increasing the warming rate.',
			'And disrupted ecosystems. And disrupted thermal currents. And methane releases. It\'s a global game of Kerplunk.',
			'And increased acidity of the oceans. And more dead zones. And mass die offs of non-migratory animals and plants.',
			'Meaning no more oxygen for us.',
			'Methane releases that by themselves could possibly be an extinction level event.',
			'You forgot the methane hydrates at the bottom of the ocean, which if released from warming could release more methane than permafrost melting, leading to a runaway warming effect. ',
			'I thought I read somewhere that these dissipate and never reach the surface.',
			'Methane hydrates are a class of complex compounds with a methane gas molecule surrounded by water molecules in an intricate structure that are formed in the intense pressure and cold water of the deep ocean.  In some areas, global warming will warm the water enough to destabilize the structure of the hydrate, releasing methane gas. In deeper regions, the intense pressure will be so high that even an increase of 5C in water temp won\'t be enough to destabilize the molecule.  Once the structure of the compound has been destabilized, methane gas will be released and bubble up to the surface where it will contribute to atmospheric global warming - there\'s no way to stop that. But you\'re right inthat not all of the methane hydrate is at risk of being destabilized. ',
			'Thanks for the clarification!',
			'At stable temps sure. ',
			'Natural gas has a relatively low solubility in water so it will bubble to surface, right now the ocean is undersaturated with methane so you\'re right until we cross a phase boundary and see significant emission.

(The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition) Producing a single hamburger uses enough fuel to drive 20 miles and causes the loss of five times its weight in topsoil. (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins)  Water  Nearly half of all the water used in the United States goes to raising animals for food (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins). It takes more than 2,400 gallons of water to produce 1 pound of meat and only 25 gallons to produce one pound of wheat (“Water Inputs in California Food Production” by Marcia Kreith) To produce a day’s food for one meat-eater takes over 4,000 gallons; for a lacto-ovo vegetarian, only 1200 gallons; for a vegan, only 300 gallons (The Vegetarian Times Complete Cookbook) Animals raised for food produce approximately 130 times as much excrement as the entire human population and animal farms pollute our waterways more than all other industrial sources combined. Run-offs of animal waste, pesticides, chemicals, fertilizers, hormones and antibiotics are contributing to dead zones in coastal areas, degradation of coral reef and health problems.

Krupa)  Air  The massive amounts of excrement produced by livestock farms emit toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia into the air. Roughly 80% of ammonia emissions in the U.S. come from animal waste (The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). When the cesspools holding tons of urine and feces get full, factory farms will frequently get around water pollution limits by spraying liquid manure into the air, creating mists that are carried away by the wind.

Fish on fish farms must be fed 5 pounds of wild-caught fish to produce one pound of farmed fish flesh (“The Food Revolution” by John Robbins) The world’s cattle alone consume a quantity of food equal to the caloric needs of 8.7 billion people—more than the entire human population on Earth (“The Global Benefits of Eating Less Meat” by Mark Gold and Jonathon Porritt)  Climate Change  Animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of the total release of greenhouse gases world-wide (this is more than all the cars, trucks, planes, and ships in the world combined) (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) Livestock account for an estimated 9% of global CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) emissions, estimated 35-40% of global CH4 (Methane) emissions and 65% of NO2 (Nitrous Oxide) emissions (Livestock’s Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, a 2006 report published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) By replacing your “regular car” with a Toyota Prius the average person can prevent the emission of about 1 tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere, By replacing an omnivorous diet with a vegan diet the average person can prevent the emission of about 1.5 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere. That’s 50% more CO2 saved! (“It’s better to green your diet than your car”, The New Scientist, December 17, 2005.) In addition to all of the above, let’s not forget that the expansion of livestock farming is one of the key factors leading to deforestation in parts of the world such as Latin America and posing a significant threat of the Earth’s biodiversity. Our Oceans are not being spared either and over-fishing is having a devastating impact on our marine ecosystems. This is not just a problem that impacts our planet, it’s a humanitarian crisis. Our demand for animal based products is diverting precious resources like land, water and fossil fuels to produce farmed animals instead of feeding the estimated billion + people that are malnourished in the world. We can all start working on sustainable alternatives or attempt to make sustainable choices as a solution to this problem, but the easiest solution is the elimination of the demand for animal based products. Switching to a plant-based lifestyle is the only long term solution that not only benefits the environment, but also the animals and our health.  HEALTH  Recent evidence from large prospective US and European cohort studies and from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies indicates that the long-term consumption of increasing amounts of red meat and particularly of processed meat is associated with an increased risk of total mortality, cardiovascular disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes, in both men and women. The association persists after inclusion of known confounding factors, such as age, race, BMI, history, smoking, blood pressure, lipids, physical activity and multiple nutritional parameters in multivariate analysis. The association has not always been noted with red meat, and it has been absent with white meat. There is evidence of several mechanisms for the observed adverse effects that might be involved, however, their individual role is not defined at present. It is concluded that recommendations for the consumption of unprocessed red meat and particularly of processed red meat should be more restrictive than existing recommendations. Restrictive recommendations should not be applied to subjects above about 70 years of age, as the studies quoted herein did not examine this age group, and the inclusion of sufficient protein supply (e. g. in the form of meat) is particularly important in the elderly. Link to study Processed meat is considered to be any meat which has been modified in order either to improve its taste or to extend its shelf life. Methods of meat processing include salting, curing, fermentation, and smoking. Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by-products such as blood. Processed meat products include bacon, ham, hotdogs, sausages, salami, corned beef, beef jerky, canned meat and meat-based sauces. Meat processing includes all the processes that change fresh meat with the exception of simple mechanical processes such as cutting, grinding or mixing. IARC at the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as a Group 1, carcinogenic to humans, since it has found sufficient evidence that consumption of processed meat by humans causes colorectal cancer.  WORLD HUNGER  Instead of using our resources in the most energy-efficient way possible by growing plants to feed directly to people, we currently use our dwindling land and water to grow grain to then feed to animals who we then eat, giving us considerably less bang for our resource “buck.” By some estimates, we could feed 1.4 billion additional people simply by giving up beef, pork, and poultry in the United States. Think of what we could do if the entire world gave up all animal products!  HUMAN COST   NY Times Article Many reports of humans suffering in the Animal Ag industry..

To live in constant fear and anxiety is unhealthy, so most people eventually adapt and normalize things, and instead deal with what we have evolved for, short and middle distance threats. Things that are immediate and concrete.  And the planet warming up does not intrude into most of our lives on a daily basis with ominous colours or sickening odors that would scare us. This makes it easy to forget. Occasional reminders pop up, but everyday life goes on.  Climate change is huge, invisible, distant, affecting various regions differently. And it is painfully slow by our standards.  As a cherry on top, it\'s effect are delayed by decades and they can turn up on a different continent. We work on cause and effect logic, most of the time anyway, and we can only spot the impact using statistics and research. People with poor understanding of such things or just plain mistrusts science or things they don\'t personally experience, are not going to see it until it starts ruining their lives directly, and by that time it will be much too late.  Scientists have been giving doomsday prediction for a long time, and because the world didn\'t end shortly thereafter, people have gotten used to ignoring them. It just isn\'t real enough yet.  Bills to pay today > probable inhospitable planet in 200 + years.  We also have a problem convincing people to give up conveniences, creature comforts or things we deem necessities without holding an axe over their heads.  Scientists are cautious by nature, their estimates are more often than not modest, and most of them use very sober language. Few of them would go out and say \'we really are screwed six ways to Sunday if this goes on any longer.\' And because it\'s science, not all studies agree with one another about how bad it will get and how soon, and a few mercenaries or odd balls deny the whole thing altogether. Those who don\'t want it to be true or doubt it can find something to "prove" them right, even though it means ignoring everything else.  There is also the too common belief in the specialness of humans. That we can\'t go extinct, because some higher power or our own inventions will save the day. That things will work out, somehow. Basically, a deus ex machina. Climate change is just about the worst type of problem for humans to face, because so many of it\'s aspects do not suit what we usually respond to or our nature. ',

Measureless disasters have loomed all our lives and, somehow, never really managed to actually come about. And this is why people are skeptical.

			'from that page you linked, range of scholar opinions:   Claude Cahen[2] and Shelomo Dov Goitein[3] argue against historic antisemitism in Muslim lands, writing that discrimination practiced against non-Muslims was of general nature, and not targeted specifically at Jews.[4] For these scholars, antisemitism in Medieval Islam was local and sporadic rather than general and endemic. Bernard Lewis[5] writes that while Muslims have held negative stereotypes regarding Jews throughout most of Islamic history, these stereotypes were different from European antisemitism because, unlike Christians, Muslims viewed Jews as objects of ridicule, not fear. He argues that Muslims did not attribute "cosmic evil" to Jews.[6] In Lewis\' view, it was only in the late 19th century that movements first appeared among Muslims that can be described as antisemitic in the European forms.[7]   wonder what happened in late 19th century, oh that\'s right colonialism and zionism.   Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that there are mostly negative references to Jews in the Quran and Hadith, and that Islamic regimes treated Jews in degrading ways. Jews (and Christians) had the status of dhimmis. They state that throughout much of history Christians treated Jews worse, saying that Jews in Christian lands were subjected to worse polemics, persecutions and massacres than under Muslim rule.[8] According to Walter Laqueur, the varying interpretations of the Quran are important for understanding Muslim attitudes. Many Quranic verses preach tolerance towards the Jews; others make hostile remarks about them (which are similar to hostile remarks made against those who did not accept Islam). Muhammad interacted with Jews living in Arabia: he preached to them in hopes of conversion, he fought against and killed many Jews, while he made friends with other Jews.[9] For Martin Kramer, the idea that contemporary antisemitism by Muslims is authentically Islamic "touches on some truths, yet it misses many others". Kramer believes that contemporary antisemitism is due only partially to Israeli policies, about which Muslims may have a deep sense of injustice and loss. But Kramer attributes the primary causes of Muslim antisemitism to modern European ideologies, which have infected the Muslim world.[10]  ',
			'ockquote> that Jews in Christian lands were subjected to worse polemics, persecutions and massacres than under Muslim rule.[8]  Wait, so because the Christians were antisemitic assholes, it justifies Islams/Muslims antisemitism today?   Many Quranic verses preach tolerance towards the Jews;  Yes, the Quran shows Muhammads mindset. When he lacked power and influence in Mecca, in the beginning of his career, he showed tolerance, but when he gained power and an army, his true self came out in Medina.  In the beginning/meccan verses of the Quran, muhammad said things like "you to your religion and me to mine." He lacked power at this time. Then when he became popular, he became violent and oppression, whoever follows any other religion than Islam will go to hell forever.  Kramer believes that contemporary antisemitism is due only partially to Israeli policies,  Yes, only partially. Other parts include Islam.  But Kramer attributes the primary causes of Muslim antisemitism to modern European ideologies, which have infected the Muslim world.  Please go on, I am interested in this.',

Other than Muslim soldiers in the British Raj being sent to the jungles of Myanmar, deserts of Northern Africa, and urban warfare in Europe. Most of Pakistan\'s curriculum is focused on creating a national identity. History of Muslim Empires ruling the subcontinent, servitude under the Brits, and fear of being a minority under Hindu rule yada yada. The denial of a Pakistani of the holocaust happening, while it should be held differently, than say a German, Italian, or American saying the same, is an aggression to learning of failures by humanity. The developed world where free knowledge and exchange happen on a continuous basis compared to Pakistan where fiefdoms and indentured "prisoners with jobs" is the norm.

Somewhere in their angry minds they think by denying the holocaust it will give them more justifications to be angry with zionists. It is unfortunate however that a personal religion has been exploited to become nationistic propaganda in creating a single state identity known as Israel. Not ironically you will rarely see zionists quoting their religion as part of their Zionist propaganda since even Israel is a modern constitution which does not quote their religion. So it really doesn’t have much to do with religion but how the holocaust turned Russian and European Jews into a race that was descriminatee against. They called themselves Jews so they became a race of Jews. The next situation that has to do with the Middle East is then religious based but they are not religious.

In part, this was a product of the expulsionist elements in the ideologies of both sides in the conflict. By 1948, many in the Zionist leadership accepted the idea and necessity of transfer, and this affected events during the war. But this gradual acceptance was in large part a response to the expulsionist ideology and violent praxis of al-Husseini and his followers during the previous two decades. Both national movements entered the mid-1940s with an expulsionist element in their ideological baggage. .... EDIT: Forgot to say how repulsive it is to compare a deliberate killing of six million people, with a civil war that resulted with at most several thousand people dead and some populations being pushed out and/or escaping the war.

			'A guarantee of payment funds for the Pakistani military\'s helicopter unit (Askari Aviation) is standard procedure, actually. A small price to pay for high-altitude rescue by the specialized aerial unit of a very poor country, rescuing rich foreigners climbing peaks in their mountain region, perhaps? The crowdfunding campaign was able to meet (and exceed its €60,000) goal, and the Polish government would "provide financial guarantees and support for the rescue operation". (source) And according to a Guardian article (posted Sat 27 Jan 2018 19.06 EST), "...Pakistan’s military responded by picking up a group of Polish climbers attempting the ascent of K2, the world’s second highest mountain, and taking them to base camp at 4,800 metres.... Meanwhile, helicopters from Askari Aviation, owned by the Pakistani military, flew around the mountain to find Revol and Mackiewicz, after the batteries on their tracker and satellite phone had gone flat."

			'You ignored my comment.  Yes, this is a life and death situation, where knowing participants took a huge risk for the sake of hobby, knowing that they might die. Because of your perceived delay to action by the Pakistani government, you referred to the country and its people as ass backwards.  Now consider the United States, whose delay in responding to Puerto Rico\'s disaster needs resulted in the demonstrable death of many, many more people.

Obviously the country isn\'t super developed so it\'s not like they have all this money just sitting around to spend on this kinda shit, and providing free rescues would just encourage people to keep coming back and putting themselves and the lives of rescuers in danger again and again, and wasting more taxpayer money.  The fucking mountain is called Killer Mountain for a reason. If you want to put your own life in extreme danger again and again, fine, but why should it cost everyone else huge sums of money just so you can keep beating your head against a wall (both climbers have already failed to ascend this mountain several times)? ',
			'the money to pakistan was for a helicopter ride to get Polish rescuers from K2 base camp to Nanga Parbat. so yeah i guess the helicopter ride is dangerous as well but nobody was asking for pakistan to go directly rescue Tomek and Elisabeth. money was coming to pay for helicopter transport, pakistan delayed and even were attempting to negotiate higher. corrupt fucks. polish govt even committed to cover full cost, upon knowing that they tried to renegotiate. follow the facebook posts and twitter of the rescue organizers frustration how this unfolded. also, all these climbers are some of the best climbers in the world not just tourists trying for a summit.

They follow Americans sports, their police might have a low kill rate compared to the US but it is incredibly high compared to the rest of the 1st World. Ask a Canadian a question about history and they will answer from the US POV. (FFS ask them about Lincoln or Wilberforce and they will say "who" in regards to Wilberforce). Listening to a Canadian and an American speak is more difficult to distinguish than a Australian or Kiwi, an Englishman or an Irishman. They speak with the same words, the same volumes, the same speed, the same phrasing, a very similar accent.',
			'Just because we sound the same does not mean we are the same. And Quebecuers and Newfies sound nothing like Americans. A lot of Americans actually make fun of the Canadian accent (although foreigners might not be able to distinguish it). The British monarchy actually has a large influence on our culture but I agree, the closer you are to the border the larger the American influence.',

There are plenty of issues he had progressive stances on that he couldn\'t fully articulate if he wanted to get elected. He was always in favor of gay marriage and put justices on the court that would legalize it. Does he deserve full credit, like he\'s some savior of the LGBT community? Obviously not.

If you want me to believe that Obama was on TV telling CNN that he firmly opposes gay marriage, but secretly, he supported it, that\'s on you. "But to claim that he didn\'t play a pivotal role is a blatant lie." I don\'t think he did play a role. If anything I think held back the LGBTQ community significantly in a way that only he could have. Not having the support of a liberal black president in 2008 no less was absolutely devastating to the gay community. I know. I was there. I remember.  I was pretty triggered when in 2008 both candidates came up and announced the both opposed gay marriage. In two thousand fucking 8, still no presidential candidate is willing to support gay marriage.

Ok. roy moore has allegations against him. As Does many democrats - such as bill clinton. And several very, very prominent democrats are actually in jail because they are pedophiles. Just saying. Ok the religious freedom memo. I see no one relevant attacking it as anti lgbtq. Only news articles claiming there are people who claim it could be discriminatory. I\'m not a conspiracy theorist myself, and I\'d like to point out that this memo does not and cannot nullify the laws protecting lgbtq persons. Ok, he appointed several judges with past history of anti lgbt stuff. Very, very skimpy on the details here. Let me just point out a few more people with past history of anti-lgbt. Bill Clinton Hillary Clinton Barack Obama "No, it\'s bullshit misdirection and you know it. It\'s lip service. " Explain yourself. Trump is the first elected president to support gay marriage BEFORE and AFTER election. He is the first president to never oppose gay marriage as a candidate or president. If you want to shill go right ahead. I\'m only stating facts. "As opposed to Obama, who appointed 40% of the Supreme Court Justices who legalized gay marriage." That\'s not even remotely relevant. If obama cared about gay marriage he would have tried to make it legal himself. "Yes, he does. Because he appointed those "other people". " No he doesn\'t lol.

Ah but were that true obama wouldn have continued to oppose gay marriage after his election? And by the same logic would trump also not have announced his opposition to gay marriage after election?

And I didn\'t say Trump was opposed to gay marriage - I don\'t believe he really gives a shit either way. He doesn\'t care about values or beliefs - he cares about his image and what people think about him. He waved a rainbow flag because his evangelical support was already secure (and they have nowhere else to turn to anyway) and by doing so he might get a handful of people to say something positive about him.',

There is nothing about the charges mentioned in the headline OR that the fine is due to or related to them being gay. And if we\'re going to start a russia hates gay people conspiracy, I\'d just like to remind you all that the first US president to only ever support gay marriage was just elected in 2016. Which wasn\'t that long ago. Russia legalized gay sex 10 years before america did. Gay marriage was only legalized in 2015 in america due to the supreme court. Obama had nothing to do with it and firmly opposed gay marriage for most of his presidency.',

More correctly there are scientifically valid public opinion surveys showing that Russia is a country of homophobes, there are you tube videos of people torturing homosexuals for fun, there are god damn disappearances of homosexuals and mass murders being conducted.  3) Obama pretty clearly supported gay marriage and rights - though you are right to his shame he did not do so openly. 4) Gay sex has been legal in the united states for a very long time. Its just that its a constitutional thing and states kept their invalid prohibitions on the books instead of taking the purely administative step to remove them.  5) Obama appointed the judges to the court who ruled in favor of it, and was not firmly opposed to it, rather he had a public position of opposition while being pretty clear that his real feelings were in favour of it.  But more than anything else, you should really reconsider the entire tone of your position because there are people being murdered by the Russian government for being gay right now and being a useful fool has real world consquences.

There is no news source reputable or otherwise and I read them all taken from liberal sources on reddit. you are argueing from the viewpoint of someone who didnt do a lick of research. Quite literally, you read a headline, read some comments, came to an insane conclusion that could only be reached through incredible bias and mental gymnastics, and are now parroting it as fact.  "A strawman argument is when you state your opponent\'s position in an exaggerated inaccurate manner and then argue against that, false, position. Being so certain that I have made a strawman argument and being totally incorrect about it really begs the question of what else you are wrong about." I am well aware of what a strawman argument is, but thanks. Let me explain something to you. I stated that obama did nothing to legalize gay marriage. you argued that people he appoint DID do something. Ok, do you understand that you are exaggerating my argument in an inaccurate manner to mean \'nothing obama directly or indirectly did had any effect on legalizing gay marriage\'. As I said, obama had nothing to do with it. You exaggerated the argument, and then argued against that exaggeration as being false. Are you getting this? If you took what I said at face value it would be true. But you didn\'t. You claim it to be a much broader and exaggerated claim, then made the argument that that claim was false. That is a strawman argument. Unlike you I have no need to beg questions about what else you are wrong about. I think it is pretty obvious.',
			'ockquote> If you took what I said at face value it would be true. But you didn\'t.  This is actually a consistent theme in your posts - you accept everything at face value. Russia legalises homosexuality but the government keeps killing gay people but to you, since they legalised it, they won the race to equality. Russia doesn\'t permit gay marriage and you say the US only has for a few years so they are not that far behind. You see a gay couple being fined and accept the government\'s answer as to why at face value. The real world requires some reading between the lines to get to the truth.',

If you take all of the emotion out of it and just look purely on the numbers, it\'s both cheaper (substantially) and more effective to have universal health care. The fact that there are so many people against it can only be explained by decades of propaganda, funded largely by people who stand to gain financially.

Prior to Citizens United, corporations and unions had to stop electioneering expenditures between 1 month to 2 months before the election, depending on the type of election. Electioneering activity is any action directly promoting or opposing a particular candidate or policy. And if you consider the nature of the 1st amendment in its 200+ years of interpretation, Citizens United\'s result is neither shocking nor surprising.

			'The important part is that corporations could not be barred from running ads for or against politicians or issues, so long as they were acting independent of the campaign. In some cases those corporations did not need to reveal their donors.  The logic was that if John Q Public really cared about proposition 23 he could spend 30million on ads against it. Why couldn\'t his corporation? As long as it wasn\'t financing a campaign it wasn\'t illegal or against any regulations. So 501(c)3 corporations don\'t need to reveal their donors. So instead of John having his name behind the campaign (maybe he is a known puppy murderer) he can give 30 million to Citizens Advocating Responsible Ethics. People don\'t know what CARE is, but they sound on the up and up.  But the truth may be that Prop. 23 would make bath beads illegal since they harm wildlife, and John Q Public, besides killing puppies also owns the biggest bath bead manufacturer in the state. So the people might be led to believe that CARE is a grassroots organization of concerned citizens when in reality it is just John\'s money and paid volunteers. That\'s the problem.

			'The short answer is: probably not. The ties go back decades, not years. Tax returns anyone?There is more and more coming out, but remember, this testimony is from November. It is safe to assume that Mueller has so much dirt on the Trump organization at this point, that no one is going to get away unscathed unless they flip. And it doesn\'t stop with Trump. The Kushner family has been up to the same shady dealings, and now they\'re in the shithole along with everyone else who remains in the inner circle. Get your popcorn folks, because this show is just getting started. ',
			'I know Mueller has some of the best white collar investigators on his team. He\'s probably got a team of forensic accountants going through Trumps and his inner circle\'s financial dealings. It\'s gonna take some time to untangle this web.  Putin and his mafia state are no novices at this. Trump presumably hired pretty good accountants and financial managers to cover the trail. Offshore accounts, shell companies, to get access to accounts and follow the trail will take time for even the best forensic accountants.  Bannon said what most of us have been thinking in the Fury and Fire book that what it\'s gonna boil down to is laundering money. The collusion if it did happen, might be more of byproduct of the money laundering and the meddling was done so knowing that Trump couldn\'t directly take a hardline stance against Russia and wouldn\'t push the issue.  Putin probably believed Trump and his family wouldn\'t be as incompetent as they\'ve shown to be. ',
			'A good question is how does Mueller move out now. He seems to have enough information for an obstruction charge. But if he\'s following the money and identifying other crimes, does he charge obstruction and money laundering all at once or charge obstruction now and at a later date drop the money laundering? ',
			'With the recent story about Trump wanting to fire Mueller coming to light. I think what happens is that Trump continues to try and undermine Mueller and the FBI. None of that will lead to any action though because firing Mueller will undoubtedly hasten any possible impeachment.  Mueller has cooperating witnesses, he\'s moving relatively quickly anyways. I think you finish the investigation before you bring charges and release a report.  That way the full scope of everything is known and made public. There\'s a question of bringing charges against Trump anyways, can he be charged?  Given the fact republicans hold the house and senate, even if he does bring charges of obstruction and laundering and the full extent of it isn\'t known and evidence isn\'t overwhelming and ironclad. It\'s not going to do much because of congressional make up.  He needs to make sure he\'s got all his ducks in a row. In a midterm year, it\'s going to be a touchy issue but I think the fact it\'s a midterm year means he\'s safe to keep continuing his work. ',

Instead she started demanding a second independence referendum before she knew what the outcome of the negotiations would be, which she wanted to hold as soon as she could (obviously she\'s got one eye on her own majority being under threat circa 2021 and not being able to call one at all). What she forgot of course is that Scotland does actually have some conservative voters and unionists, and she spooked them sufficiently to lose about 13 seats in the Borders and Aberdeenshire/ Moray. If she\'d held those seats, the Tories would have lost the country. Yes you can say that she was coming off a high base, but Sturgeon didn\'t need to play this card, and there was a time she might have lost them to Labour. Instead she allowed the Tories to win through her own misjudgement I\'m not totally convinced either that she didn\'t contribute to the Brexit result too, albeit I\'d equally accept I\'m being harsh on her. She was the only speaker in the debates who had latched onto just what Boris Johnson was up and correctly accused him of pursuing a cloaked leadership campaign rather than a policy he believed. Well done Nicola, but then her legal background deserted her and she failed to follow up with a series questions that could have pinned Johnson to the wall had she explained to the voters the mechanisms that Boris was seeking to exploit (the conservative party leadership rules) and especially if she\'d been able to hit him with some of his pro-EU statements from the time he was Mayor of London. Sadly Sturgeon just made the allegation and then allowed it to slip.

			'Quite a lot of train conductors will tell people they get ripped off if they buy through ticketmaster, which is quite nice imo.',
			'I\'ve reread your comment and the one above it a dozen times, and I still don\'t understand where train conductors come into it.',
			'In the UK ticketmaster do package deals that include the train or bus fare through a partnership with a few of the train/bus companies. These are usually \'e-tickets\' which have ticketmaster branding and the conducter just scans the code, so he can see which outlet you bought it through.  Ticketmaster will tell the buyer of these package deals that they are saving 25% on the rail price or whatever. However, in the UK train prices are infuriatingley changeable - booking at different times in advance from different sites can save a lot of money for one of trips. Also, UK train conductors are generally some of the nicest blokes you\'ll ever find in positions of authority, mainly because the UK has a specific police force for the railways which manages to avoid most of the political bullshit normal police forces face and as such is left to do its job, so the train company inspectors aren\'t a paramilitary style force like Deutsche Bahn Sicherheit full of steroid addicted meatheads.  Therefore it\'s quite normal for a british train conductor to check tickets, see a ticketmaster package ticket and have a very friendly 5 minute chat with the holder about how they could have saved money by buying off a train specific site and that the \'discount\' they have been quoted is for the 8am Monday morning high speed express train with blackjack and hookers, rather than the 40 year old 3rd class stinkwagon with the drunk football fans they are actually sat on at 9pm on a Wednesday going to watch Celine Dion.',

			'I think the big issue that most people have with Ticketmaster isn’t the cost of the ticket. It’s the crazy fees they add on top of it. Nothing like trying to buy a $50 ticket, and then seeing that it’s gonna be $90 after various bullshit fees. Oh, and then they charge those fees for each ticket, even if you purchase them all at the same time. I have no issues paying $90 for a $90 ticket. I have issues paying $90 for a $50 ticket though, especially when those fees are for “convenience” but there’s not an inconvenient way to avoid those fees even available. ',

			'Cheaper tickets, don\'t allow them to be resold, and your problems are solved. Some people will have to eat the cost of the tickets if they can\'t make it, but since they didn\'t pay 200 bucks per ticket, they should be able to afford it more easily.',
			'[deleted]',
			'Yeah, festival events are probably a different beast. I\'m thinking more along the lines of a normal single band headliner concert or a comedy show. And its not like you should have ID proof to go with the ticket, but the bands themselves need to not allow them for resell on sites like stubhub. If you ban the ability to re-sell your tickets on a site like that, companies aren\'t going to get bots to buy up all the tickets to try and work out a Craig\'s List resell. And personally, my preference (and I may be fortunate to have this option a lot) is to buy from the venue itself, or at least through the company the venue works with. These aren\'t big arena venues, but are well known concert venues in the area. Its standing room only or a separate VIP section for a bit more. The tickets are usually cheap enough that I don\'t mind as much about the additional BS fee because at least I know my view of the show is dependent on when I get there. There\'s nothing worse than having to pay out the ass for crappy seats to a show you want to see when you can see tons of empty seats all around the place and plenty of tickets still up for sale online. I can\'t imagine the performers enjoy seeing a lot of empty seats out there either, especially when merchandise sales at these shows are a nice little boost to their bottom line too.',
			'Thing is, drip pricing isn\'t illegal. As long as all the fees are on the final bill before you agree to pay for it, it\'s fine. Canada is like the world centre of fast lube places. The largest one, Mr. Lube does this. You look outside and the sign reads "$20 Oil Change." But the oil change is never $20, it always varies between $60-120. You have choices in oil, of which the one that suits your car is probably not $20. There are also extras they try and sell you and push on you. So it might be a shock when you read off the bill. With Ticketmaster you have to pay the stadium fees, online fees, seat selection fees, all sorts of stuff. But I mean... you never pay for this without knowing about it. The only thing Ticketmaster has on people is that in most Canadian cities due to a jarring gap in the live entertainment industry, tickets sell out within minutes. A nice sliver goes to bots but when you\'re filling out the forms and paperwork for Ticketmaster, if you don\'t lock in your ticket right away, it\'s gone.',

			'That makes no sense. Why would they charge less for a service that costs them more to provide?',
			'Probably because many people find more value in being able to print their tickets themselves and so are willing to pay more for it.

Sure, the artist may feel bad for their fans, but they probably don’t have much of a choice in the matter. Use Ticketmaster for your sales, or get blacklisted from a HUGE list of venues that are getting paid by Ticketmaster is an ultimatum that makes it hard for artists to boycott Ticketmaster. Collectively, they COULD all boycott it and throw em out of business, but good luck getting that many artists to give up their income to fight the power or whatever. ',

Not everyone is that tech-savvy that they can setup a server which can handle the load of hundred of thousands of people logging in at the same time, trying to buy a ticket (if the artist is famous enough). It\'s probably also more cost efficient to hire a business to do this for you who specializes in this line of work instead of hiring your own private team to set this up. Depending on the artist, you probably can\'t employ them full-time either (you can\'t be on tour all the time because they need time off or need time to record a new album for instance.)

			'How about Russian Nazi\'s? That\'s more baffling to me.',
			'There are American Nazis too, bizarrely. We fought a war against those guys, it\'s a pretty major source of national pride for us.',
			'To be honest - I don\'t care as much about American Nazi\'s. Considering how many Russians Nazi\'s have killed vs. Americans, there\'s no comparison what so ever.',
			'not only that, but most American Neo-Nazis seem to be redneck Militias/Groups who don\'t really commit too many crimes out of fear of serious jailtime. whereas russian ones are far more active.',
			'I have some firsthand experience with Russian Nazi\'s so I can confirm. I think the American Neo Nazi\'s are a mix of racists, KKK-related people, militians, and similar anti-government groups. I do think they\'re dangerous and perhaps more dangerous now than a few decades ago.',
			'What\'s your experience with Russian nazis? ',
			'Born and raised in the Soviet Union, my family was classified as Jewish. The first day of class, you\'re required to state your nationality and my card read "Jew". A fellow classmate pointed to some teenagers (I was in the 4th grade I think) who were skinheads and wore swastika\'s. They chased me but gave up after I ran into a building and hid on a stairwell.',

As far as discrimination, the gym teacher loved me because I was the fastest runner and I was #2 at high jump (her favorite sport) so she defended me against other teachers. Since I was friends with the tallest girl (we stood next to one another in gym class and she was #1 in high jump), I had a few guys leave me alone because they wanted attention from her. It was luck. The one incident I described was the worst of it and, to be honest, I only recently thought about my life back in the Soviet Union and the news about Nazi\'s in the US resurfaced some of these feelings plus I discovered the other secrets of my family during WWII which just overwhelmed me.',
			'ockquote> Redneck   Using derogatory slurs or generalizing doesn\'t make your point true. The number of actual nazis is very small - somewhere between five to ten thousand. ',
			'Nazism is an ideology - that\'s like saying it makes no sense to be an American communist because of the Cold War. Most Neo-Nazis believe that WW2 should have never have been fought, and that Britain should have accepted Rudolf Hess\' offer of peace in 1941, and the Nazi empire and the British empire could have coexisted and created an ideal White world for all. "Our forefathers fought two world wars, they thought to keep us free But I\'m not sure, that in those wars, who was the enemy? The Zionists own the media, and they\'re known for telling lies And I could see, that it might be, we fought on the wrong side" (Lyrics from Ian Stuart, a British neonazi in the 80s and early 90s. I think this stance is fairly typical, if that helps you understand) Source: Not a Nazi, but as a free speech activist you encounter these things. I\'ve grown to greatly admire Stuart actually, despite disagreeing with the racial aspects of his views',
			'You\'re generalizing to an extreme degree. At best, a majority of Americans take pride in going to war against the Nazis, but there are clearly still a significant group of people who idolize them - As was the case back then as well. It\'s not like every American thought that they should side with the allies.  Blanket statements muddy the waters when it comes to history. ',
			'Russian werr Commies, not Nazis. Nazis hated Russia.',
			'Just like there are people in western welfare states sympathizing with the Soviet Union and believing Communism to be the answer to everything, there are people in ex-Communist regimes who always sympathized with the extreme right.  It\'s only baffling if you outright assume that literally ever Russian individual was on board with Communism, and that\'s just as much of a silly generalization as suggesting that every 1930\'s German was a passionate Nazi.  In both cases, there were fairly large groups of people who absolutely detested their regimes and romanticized the other as a result. It makes just as much sense for there to be Russian Nazis now as it makes sense for there to be German Communists. ',
			'But the issue isn\'t just ideology, these people killed a quarter of the population. ',
			'And? Why would their sympathizers care? Of course it\'s about ideology. Russia is so vast that you can\'t expect everyone to share a nationalistic bond. If anti-Communists and right-wingers heard of Communists being killed on the front lines, they\'d be cheering on the Nazis, waiting for their liberation. Many Germans rejoiced when their "enemies" (The allies) came to liberate them from the Nazis - Even though they killed a lot of Germans to get there. ',
			'ockquote> the extreme right.  What makes Nazis "extreme right" though? They were literally socialists.',
			'They were literally not socialists though, but fair enough. I already sense that you have no idea what you\'re talking about, but let\'s just go on for the fun of it. Nazis are "extreme right" because they were some of the most profound nationalists this world has ever seen, coupled with their faith in eugenics as a way to maintain racial purity. They deliberately described other kinds of people and other cultures as being lesser than their own - As in, they should be restricted or purged entirely. I think that\'s about as much as I can be bothered to type on the issue. I\'m not actually going to sit here and debate with someone who seems to think Nazis are left-leaning.  You know how "The Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea" has "Democratic" in the name, but isn\'t actually a democracy? Yeah, just because the Nazis had "Socialist" in there, doens\'t mean they were "literally socialists".',
			'ockquote> nationalists  Nothing inconsistent with socialism, or communism there.  their faith in eugenics as a way to maintain racial purity  Pretty much neutral on the economics/communism spectrum  They deliberately described other kinds of people and other cultures as being lesser than their own  I literally haven\'t heard of any left leaning society ever that couldn\'t be described that way. At least economically, the Nazis were to the left of the US.',
			'I don\'t even know what to tell you. I don\'t much care for your attempts at vague and subversive arguments. This is some grotesque nonsense.  But alright. Go on, live in your little bubble where right-wingers don\'t actually exist and Bernie Sanders is a dictator in the making or whatever. I don\'t care.',
			'Bernie Sanders is an extremely far cry from a dictator. I\'m just saying, it\'s hard to call a government that controls the mean of production "right wing". Maybe I\'m biased since as an atheist who would like to see weed legalized, abortions 100% allowed, and reasonable cost placed on carbon emissions, the main thing that attracts me to the right wing is Economics.',

Articles of clothing are often worn to make a "statement", and the kippah (aka yarmulka), is no different. Pew Research: What different styles of head coverings say about Israeli Jewish men Quote:   While wearing a kippa in everyday life is primarily a statement of religious identity, in Israel, certain types of kippot can indirectly be strong clues about some of the wearer’s political views. In fact, the term “kippa sruga” (knitted kippa) is sometimes used to describe “religious Zionists,” observant Jews who see the Jewish people as religiously entitled to territory in the region. The data support such an association. Among men who wear colored or patterned knitted kippot, a majority (63%) say the term “Zionist” describes them very accurately. By contrast, most of those who wear a large black fabric kippa (58%) say the “Zionist” label does not describe them accurately; this group is made up largely of Haredim, some of whom have long been ambivalent about the Jewish state. Majorities of those who wear a colored or patterned knitted or crocheted kippa agree with the statement “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel” (65%) and say peaceful coexistence for Israel and an independent Palestinian state is not possible (58%). Likewise, about seven-in-ten men who wear a black crocheted kippa agree that Arabs should be expelled or transferred, including 45% who strongly agree. And fully three-quarters of those who wear a black crocheted kippa (75%) say a two-state solution is not possible.  Read more at the link.

That being said we are not in fact hunter gatherers anymore so we also have to deal with huge swaths of land being rendered useless, cities being swallowed by the ocean, disease outbreaks as living conditions worsen, food and water shortages etc. Edit: Also many artifacts were left on top of snow fields or glaciers and subsequently buried by more snow. We are finding them now because its hard to dig through snow endlessly looking for easily destructible items.

			'The main flaw with combatting climate change is the world is not supposed to stay the way it is. The world is moving, tectonics, all forms of erosion, hydrologic cycles, geologic cycles, it’s supposed to change.  Climate changes caused them to be covered in the first place... ie the ending Roman warm period and ending medieval warm period. Plus the little ice age. Glaciers advance and retreat over centuries . And overall Glaciers have been retreating for 30,000 years. Next ice age should start in 5,000-10,000 years. There’s some hemispherical and regional differences as well, for example greenlands central snow pack has increased the last 50 years. We have seen a sea level increase of 50 meters since the birth of Christ. A fun little example is looking at the original coast line of Thermopylae and where the coast is now. That’s only 2,500 years (rounded). Another good example is Doggerland, the area of coastal land between England and France 6,000 years. A third example is the main formation of niagra falls is only 4,500 years old! A fourth example is the Missoula floods 15,000 years ago.  You can’t combat climate change, it’s like those idiots that try to prevent coastal erosion because they built their house on a barrier island that is basically a large sandbar that over 1,000 years moves and connects to the coast and a new one forms. The beach is different everyday. That’s nature.  You CAN combat “global warming” but I wouldn’t target your carbon footprint id target other pollutants and prevent deforestation and burning/destruction of photosynthesis vehicles. CO2 is the most important substance on our planet. And we need more of it as fuel for photosynthesis.  Main thing is, don’t be a pawn for someone’s corporate greed or yearning for billions of tax dollars. See presentations by meteorologist and physicist below. Actual scientists. Most of the green industry I consider actually and truly evil. It is way more complex and insidious than the oil business.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?sns=em&v=LyztWNW2HsM https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=SyUDGfCNC-k Now compare this website belowand the names and backgrounds on it (actually comprised of 10,000 scientists and doctors) but isn’t funded by cronyism. They aren’t climate deniers or believers, a true scientist is neither. These are people who want it to be handled like actual science and not monetarily driven.  Www.petitionproject.org And compare it to this organizations website below; its staff, management, members. I guarantee less than 1% of 1% of the “500,000” are actually scientists. The same staff is present in many of their “teams” and the average age and background is younger and less impressive and only a dozen somewhat qualified individuals, with a history of biased approaches. I don’t know what correlation this is but it’s also female dominated, just a observation. I’m very pro female but females tend to be more emotional, not good dispassionate data interpretation.  Www.ucusa.org Look how much better their website is and the funding that went into it (tax dollars). I’m sure donations as well.  A true scientist does not accept anything with a certainty. The true determination on mans effect of the atmosphere will probably take another century or two with an unbiased collection of data. You cannot have people who have the conclusion determined before the process even begins be conducting the experiments and data collection and interpretation, It needs to be impartial and dispassionate. Recent issues at NOAA and the existence of the Paris accord are extremely alarming. Follow the money. Always.  Handling ALL science like this is where we grow as a species, presenting theories as certainties for fame, money, funding is not how to handle it. It all becomes instantly flawed no matter the topic. And who fact checks a decade of data? AI will help a lot hopefully bc humans can’t be trusted if there’s money and attention involved. Plain and simple.  This is a million year discussion not a 50 year discussion. Hopefully over the next century we will have the models to start accurately projecting global weather patterns. As of right now our models don’t even know what’s going to happen Tuesday let alone 100 years from now. ',

			'Not sure why you\'re getting down voted to shit: you raise good points in places, although you present your argument from a "fuck you, I\'m right stance". Perhaps this is the reason for the down voting. I view climate change through the same lens as contaminating other planets with our life: we shouldn\'t do it, but it\'s unavoidable given the circumstances. If nature had it her way, we wouldn\'t exist at all. But life finds a way. My main counterpoints are this: global warming fuels climate change. If we can curb global warming we can directly affect how the climate changes. While this isn\'t the way nature intended things to go, neither is having the ability to type what I\'m typing. Nature didn\'t intend for microcomputers or social media, etc. we engineered the ability to make it happen. No ones going to argue the overall benefit. Science is great: it allows engineers to create awesome stuff. But if engineers constantly lived under the umbrella of science without trying anything new, the Information Age would have never happened.  I agree that big money is a bad thing. Especially concerning science, its influence and reach. But that shouldn\'t be the arbiter for stifling engineered solutions when they exist. Capitalism sucks, but if another system was better, it would have taken its place. Until the perfect Utopia exists, this is the best we\'ve got: money fuels economy, technology creates money, technology needs science. Plain and simple. ',
			'True, and yet the world was once warm enough for people to be running around in what is now glacier covered land.

This might sound counter-intuitive to begin with, but it\'s true. The large prevailing wind patterns around the globe play a large part in moving warm air from the equatorial regions towards the poles and evening out temperatures. What actually triggers ice ages is major disruptions to these wind patterns. If warm air is not transported towards the polar regions, the ice will spread, which will cause more sunlight to be reflected and help to lower temperatures further. I had this explained to me many years ago though so I\'ve probably missed major parts.',

			'It all depends on how you define it.',
			'I think the main issue here is that "Ice Age" means different things in science and in everyday life. The thing normal people call an Ice Age is actually called a glacial period in climatology:  An ice age is a period of long-term reduction in the temperature of Earth\'s surface and atmosphere, resulting in the presence or expansion of continental and polar ice sheets and alpine glaciers. Within a long-term ice age, individual pulses of cold climate are termed "glacial periods" (or alternatively "glacials" or "glaciations" or colloquially as "ice age"), and intermittent warm periods are called "interglacials". In the terminology of glaciology, ice age implies the presence of extensive ice sheets in both northern and southern hemispheres. By this definition, we are in an interglacial period—the Holocene—of the ice age. The ice age began 2.6 million years ago at the start of the Pleistocene epoch, because the Greenland, Arctic, and Antarctic ice sheets still exist.  This terminology difference causes a lot of confusion, and is then further mixed up with other issues like the long term (longer than useful human time-scales: many tens of thousands of years) approach of the next glacial period that would be expected if it were not for overwhelming human influences, as well as the mistaken belief that scientists used to warn about impending global cooling instead of global warming.',

			'I\'m not so defeatist.  We are definitely living destructively - non-sustainably - and at such a rate that we are currently bringing about a fairly terrifying future (until climate normalizes if it can).  And yes - it includes contamination of soil and water, not just air.  But on current technology we have the means to stop these problems from continuing. We are struggling in mustering will power.

The previous ice age happened when the average temperature of the earth were 4 degrees colder. We\'re now 1 degree over that average. If we were heading into an ice age, that temperature would have been dropping, but it\'s not.  The industrialization and the world temperature was in an equilibrium until the sixties, staying at the same average temperature. Since then, we\'ve increased the CO2 levels in the atmosphere by ~30%, which in turn increased the world temperature by 1 degree. We were not in any way headed towards an ice age (unless you count the one thousands of years from now, following earths usual cycle).  We are, however, dangerously close to finding out what happens when the earth gets a few degrees warmer. We already know that 4 degrees is enough of a difference to cause an ice age. ',

Plus, the cartels have other businesses, such as selling iron ore($1 billion), stealing oil from Pemex ($1 billion), and other kinds of extortion (limes, avocados, kidnapping, etc) all of which are estimated to bring them $5-$23 billion annually. Where did you get your numbers? I’d estimate marijuana at closer to 5-7% of the cartels’ income, and falling with the legalization in California.

When essentially money equals freedom to a great degree and corporations can wring every cent out of you if they so choose and then pass legislation to keep threats to their profits like low priced alternatives to their products and then enslave you through the prison system if you violate that then clearly we\'re living in some sort of dystopian state.

There are areas (not in the US) with dilaudid vending machines because they were having so many people die from cut heroin, these aren\'t even countries where drugs are legal (canada I believe does this), they just did it in certain areas because they knew they were losing the fight and did the humanitarian thing. Ya know who doesn\'t want people having drugs readily available? Pharma industries, doctors/pain management clinics (it\'s disgusting how much pain docs are profiting from the increased regulation on opioids, the costs for me to see a pain doc have skyrocketed because of it), and alcohol companies all are reaaaaallly against legalization or decriminalization. Yes, it would be bad for people to take an opioid for their pain instead of seeing their physician first to see what\'s wrong as it could be dangerous, but other than that practical risk the rest of it is financial losses for them.

The same officials appointed by Chavez and ratified by Maduro are still in place and day by day it is obvious they prefer to let thousands of children to die as long as they keep in power and "safe". This left the population defenseless. They can\'t receive humanitarian help from other governments and NGOs who already approved millions of dollars for the people in need, packages with supplies are intercepted, confiscated and sold to other countries for profit by militaries themselves. I\'ve been giving some money of my income to family member and neighbors who are in need, knowing I can help them I just can\'t let children I know to scavenging trash near my house for food they can eat. I know many others are doing the same as I do. Entire families are hopeless and without help they would probably die from starvation and preventable diseases. I got a work doing homework for friends in Venezuela who pay me in dollars and with money I get solving captcha in pages where I get paid almost $1, and every week I buy medicines to donate to hospitals, sometimes I buy food to one family give everything to them, but I\'d like to help many others because the amount of people suffering because of high prices and unemployment is depressing. They say to me that the uncertainty is such that they don\'t know what will became of them the next week, whether one of the will get sick and die because of lack of medicines. I\'ve been doing works where they pay me in crypto currencies and I will make my first donation soon to a hospital once I exchange crypto currencies to bolivares to buy enough supplies for childrens. It is heartbreaking how elder people is suffering and children, people usually ask for donations in bolivares but once they get someone who could afford for the medicine or food suplies they need, the prices rise up and more bolivares are necessary because of hyperinflation. The advantage that I have is that I can exchange my payment in dollars to bolivares quickly and buy the supplies quickly whenever they ask for it and when I can provide it to them. It is so frustrating seeing people doing lines only to buy four lb of food with their biweekly income which barely last 1 week, nothing luxury or very nutritious, mostly vegetables, not meat or sugar. It is a tragedy what is happening with teenagers who leave their schools to start working and girls who prefer to work as prostitute to afford food instead of going to school.  Call me stupid for not leaving this country but I can\'t leave knowing people I know since I was born will die because they don\'t have an income in foreign currency.

There were certainly collaborators as there were in every other German-occupied territory at the time, but many of them were either executed by the AK (Polish Home Army, the underground guerilla forces that were resisting the occupation), which was an organization that was backed by the legitimate Polish government in exile in London.  Polish collaboration can really only be talked about on a local or individual level - either villages outed their Jewish neighbours (for fear of getting executed by the Nazis, which generally happened anyway), or you had individuals working with them for monetary purposes.  Of course, you also had the complete opposite, where Jews were hidden by their Polish gentile neighbours despite the risk of execution, and you have many examples of folks like Maximillian Kolbe - a priest who volunteered to die in the place of someone else at Auschwitz. In all, it\'s a very, very sensitive topic in Poland even today, especially since there is a lot of false or misleading data when it comes to what exactly the Poles did in the war. I\'d still argue that the Poles have minimal responsibility in the Holocaust compared to other countries at the time. ',

And the difference between Holocaust denial laws is the Holocaust did happen. And there was some complicity by a percentage of Poles in the killing of Jews. However, this law attempts to circumvent that truth, as opposed to the Holocaust denial laws which attempt to protect it.',
			'The Polish government wasn\'t exactly NOT complicit either. Units of the AK were often just as likely to kill Jews trying to escape from ghettos as to aid them. During the Warsaw Ghetto revolt in 1943, units of the AK largely refused to assist the 60k ish Jews left after the Großaktion; however, this is more justifiable given that the ghetto was clearly doomed. Thus historically, I\'d say it is definitely a grey area, but the implications of this law for the current political situation in Poland are more nuanced...  the nationalist PiS is trending toward greater authoritarianism, and has been pushing anachronistic and revisionist narratives for years, such as demonizing Lech Walesa for possibly collaborating with the communists. The point isn\'t that Poland was conquered by the Nazis or that Walesa may have been an informant, the point is that the PiS is trying to create a parallel reality of history and news controlled by the government. There is also a deeper issue here though, which is that this highlights the lack of societal reconciliation to what actually happened during the Holocaust in Poland. I’ll give you an example: the Oskar Schindler museum in Krakow is essentially a shrine to the Polish army’s “defense” of the city during the German invasion. Most of the content is about the Polish people’s resistance to the Nazis, not about the Holocaust, it is honestly kind of bizarre. The reason I think this is, is because Poland never had to own up to ANY kind of complicity in the Holocaust- Germany did, and now they all have a sort of collective guilt, which I also think is fucked up but that is another discussion.  The point is that they are downplaying any role whatsoever in the Holocaust, when large parts of Polish society were and still are virulently anti-Semitic, and were definitely enablers to the Holocaust, if not outright collaborators.

Such collaboration did occur, and the Holocaust could not have taken place on such a vast scale without extensive collaboration from the Polish population. It is a political maneuver that is popular among Poles, because no one wants to face the possibility that collaboration with the Nazis happened (because it did). The Polish government has targeted authors who write about Polish collaboration with the Nazis, and has taken other steps to downplay or diminish any mention of Poles collaborating with the Nazis, like make the Oskar Schindler museum in Krakow into a shrine to the Polish army, barely mentioning Schindler and what he did. Polish society was extremely anti-Semitic during the duration of the Holocaust, and units of the AK often killed Jews just as readily as the Nazis. Being anti-Nazi doesn\'t mean you are pro-Jew.',

There were killing our national identity to make our society like typical communist society. thier worst crime was to kill 22 thousands of intelligence during WW2 in Katyń, just shooting them in occiput. For reasons soviets/russians were the most dangerous things for reborned Poland since 1918 for example. 1922 battle of warsaw, 4 years after reborn ( we didnt exist for 123 years) we stopped communists from spreading to EU. russians, then Soviets just wanted to wipe our history and identity from ourself for almost 200 years beggining from partitions of Poland (in 1772) and being the worst partiotion to live in. ( until today [nowadays you can still see differences on some tematics map] we have Poland splited for Poland A and Poland B. A = German, much better, much railways, better orginizsd cities or manufactures. B = Prussian, peripheries almost nothing, some ppl didnt have WC in houses until late 1970 So we really dont want symbols of soviet occupation, there died much much more Polsih people who was fighting for Polish freedom againts Prussia then CCCP for 200 years and people of other countries cannot understand that. They just know lastest history, and becuase CCCP was on winning side, they think they were quite ok. im just bit sad that you think we shpuld thank CCCP for all " loses" they made to conquer us after WW2.
