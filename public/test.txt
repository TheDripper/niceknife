Trump will try to use it to convince everyone his hard stance made it possible for the peace talks between NK and SK. After it\'s over everything will go back to how it has been for years.',

			'Only one? What about all the people behind the goverment? Kim is no mastermind that steers the whole nation. He is to an extension just a \'puppet\' that is expected to be a strong leader by the influential people. If he didn\'t lead the country the way he is expected to he\'d be replaced quickly. It\'s way more than just one person behind all the NK\'s atrocities.',
			'You say that like it\'s something special. No one should dislike the average North Korean, they are victims suffering under a horrible regime. ',
			'The highlight for me in one of the recent World Cups was NK get one against Brazil. Pity the NK supporters were paid Chinese and no one in NK saw him score. I was simultaneously sad and overjoyed for the guy. He fuckin scored in a World Cup against Brazil! Not many can boast that. I hope he\'s the national hero he deserves to be back home, but somehow I doubt it.',

			'Quite the other way around, this soon after the Russia scandal there\'s no way they can take it easy on someone without being crucified for double standards.',
			'Yeah that\'s another possibility. I still think we won\'t hear a single word about any test or whatever. Whether they actually do the tests, whatever the result, we won\'t hear a thing. If they test positive maybe in a couple years we\'ll get a press release "Oh btw the N. Koreans tested positive, so their results are disqualified", everyone goes "I fucking knew it" and life goes on. ',

		title: 'Bannon \'ordered to testify to grand jury\': He was reportedly subpoenaed by Mueller, who is leading an inquiry into alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election campaign. ',
		ments: [
			'This is not an interview, it is testimony in front of a grand jury. As prosecutions go. you generally are not supposed to ask a question that you don\'t already know the answer to. If Mueller is putting Bannon in front of a grand jury, it is because he already knows exactly what Bannon will say.',
			'exactly what Bannon should say assuming he doesn\'t perjure himself...',
			'Well, if his grand jury testimony is different than what he told the FBI before, he is either perjuring himself, or he lied to the FBI. Both of which are illegal. Remember, Papadopoulos went down for lying to the feds.',
			'I\'m very ignorant of these proceedings so perhaps you could assist me: Are we potentially looking at a situation where those in orbit of trump face prosecution (i.e. they take the hit) but not trump himself?  Or would Bannon\'s testimony be used to impeach trump (assuming he verifies russian influence)? And on the basis he is then impeached, can trump be prosecuted or does he benefit from some form of executive exhoneration? ',
			'So the DEA probably has the most experience, but the FBI isn\'t bad at this either. To take down a kingpin, you have to start with the soldiers until someone flips the inner circle.. then you go after the inner circle until someone flips the boss. When the FBI is indicting your inner circle, you are dodging bullets. You can only dodge for so long before you get hit. That\'s why Republicans are scrambling to shut down the investigation. ',
			'At the end of the day, you need a corrupt and very unlikely to put country before party Republican house majority to bring charges of impeachment for Donnie Dipshit. Mueller could have him admit it all but, by law, they can’t bring charges against a sitting President; only Congress can bring impeachment.  This crooked Congress seems like they want to go down with the sinking Republican Party over admit and do something about Cheeto Benito’s wrongdoings.  Even if the Democrats take control of the house in midterms this year, they’d need a supermajority of the Senators, which means about 18 Republicans would have to jump ship and vote impeachment, too. At this point, that doesn’t seem likely.  This all is really is an exercise in seeing how fucked our government is with dirty money and influence. But, in the end, it’ll probably still be up to us voters to fix the problem Congress members and Donnie probably goes free or keels from stress; unless he sticks around long enough to not be in office and get hit with the state crimes. ',
			'It\'s still not proven you cannot indict a sitting President. ',
			'This is the way that I imagine this will play out:  Bombshell gets dropped - credible evidence, more indictments and convictions - public testimony - around the likely scenario that Trump was/is laundering Russian mob money through the RNC and something around collusion to use the Russian infrastructure to hack voters. Maybe Duestch Bank (?) goes down for international money laundering. Massive public protests and pressure on Congress House flips in 2018 elections More public protests as impeachment momentum builds.  Credible polls show the Senate GOP that they need to either act or get voted out. Impeachment clears house and Senate starts their thing Trump resigns in protest / attempts to save face - somewhere in 2019 Somewhere in there the NY State AG brings charges against Trump and his family for money laundering. ',
			'Depends on what is said. Could be those around Trump could just be Trump could be the whole kit and kaboodle.',
			'Oh my god. I didn\'t think the kaboodle was involved!',
			'Yes tis a sad day when even the kaboodle is involved with presidential drama.',
			'Don’t be naive. The dark kaboodle is always involved.',
			'TIL it\'s not "kitten kaboodle". This just got a little less adorable.',
			'You should probably also know that it\'s not "Doggy Dog World". It sucks, I know.',
			'So what is the worst that could potentially happen to trump? Is it just impeachment, or could he face jail if collusion is proved?',
			'For people who have these questions, I recommend the podcast "What Trump can teach us about con law". The answer to a lot of these questions about the president are that we just don\'t know how they would play out in court. A lot of this stuff has never been tried in court.',
			'Short answer is maybe but if impeached than definitely yes.  “The prevailing view among legal scholars is that a sitting president cannot be indicted, according to recent reports. But legal opinion is divided, says Eric Freedman, professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University.” source ',
			'So (hypothetically speaking), Bannon needs to testify trump met with Russians, then they start impeachment proceedings, then Congress votes and a supermajority is needed, and if that all happens trump is then impeached.  Is he then removed from office and Pence becomes president? Or is there a new election due to their having been voter fraud?',
			'I don\'t think Bannon has been interviewed. ',
			'Our come up with a sudden, massive case of amnesia. ',
			'My understanding is that the subpoena is just a cover - Mueller will let Bannon sit for an informal interview in lieu of Grand Jury testimony. ',
			'That’s one theory. Here’s another. Mueller already knows what Bannon knows. Mueller doesn’t like to play games. In the grand jury, there is no not answering a question. There’s no council to confer with. There is a witness, prosecutor, and a room full of people. Anything Bannon knows that Mueller doesn’t know, Mueller will find out anyway from other sources, or from Bannon himself when he is trying to cut a deal. Bannon sits for the Grand Jury. Gives up all the information Mueller wants, indictments go out immediately afterwards. Whether these indictments have to do with Bannon’s testimony specifically, who knows, the proceedings are sealed. The indicted parties immediately believe Bannon rolled on them, so they roll on him. Soon everyone is scrambling for a deal and Mueller keeps chugging along.  It’s all mind games. ',
			'He has no Mercer funding, no Breitbart, no job... He got a Democrat elected in Alabama. No clout.  Cut a deal, write a book. ',
			'Well, to be fair on that last point, Roy Moore did a lot to help himself not get elected.  speaking of, did god ever let him know that he lost? ',
			'Moore hasn\'t even officially conceded yet. I guess the GOP wants to keep their new mascot around a little longer.',
			'My understanding is the courts confirmed the election, so Moore can not concede all he wants, he lost.',
			'Yep! It doesn\'t matter, he officially lost and the government is moving on without him. At this point it\'s like having a company turn you down for a position and then showing up anyway like you got it because you...Continue to insist, or maybe by this point have genuinely have convinced yourself(?) that that you did. You, uh. You don\'t get to tell the place hiring you that you got the job.  I\'m not sure Moore realizes this. I\'m not sure he can, at this point. I think his brain is just rejecting it because otherwise the cognitive dissonance will make his mind shut down, like that part in Westworld where they show Maeve her own thought process happening in real time and she kinda just goes catatonic.',
			'I\'m not surprised that he finds "reality has broken somehow" to be more likely than a republican losing an election to a democrat in Alabama.',
			'That liberal bias reality was showing back in the Obama era has gotten really out of hand these days I guess.',
			'What do you mean? I\'m being thick',
			'There was a thing a while back where the media was constantly accused of having a liberal bias, and the clap back to that was "Well, we\'re reporting reality so I guess reality has a liberal bias?" So now it\'s to the point where that liberal bias reality displays has gotten so out of hand that Alabama just went blue. I admit, it\'s kind of a dumb joke.',
			'Wasn\'t it Steven Colbert who coined the phase? I think the exact wording was, "Reality has a well-known liberal bias" Edit: It was during his speech from the George W Bush White House Correspondents\' dinner.   I know there are some polls out there saying this man has a 32% approval rating. But guys like us, we don\'t pay attention to the polls. We know that polls are just a collection of statistics that reflect what people are thinking in "reality." And reality has a well-known liberal bias. ',
			'Nah I liked it ',
			'A lot of people say in jest that reality has a liberal bias and that\'s why some parts of the GOP has a very strained relationship to reality. He is simply talking it a step further insinuating that it\'s so biased that Moore lost in Alabama as opposed to "the real thing" that is Moores worldview, where he didn\'t lose.  I don\'t know if that made sense, but it\'s essentially just a joke on their often hard time admitting the reality of things.',
			'And a lot of people say it in earnest. It\'s not really a joke, though it is humorous.',
			'He\'s going to run for Governor, mark my words. There\'s still money on the table and he\'s not going to leave it there.',
			'Good. He\'s the poster boy for the GOP. ',
			'He probably molested the poster boy already ',
			'And the horse he rode in on.',
			'If you ain’t Cav... You’ve probably never fucked a horse.',
			'What, sir? That\'s ridiculous! He\'s not interested in any homosexual abominable acts. Now, if that were a poster girl, between the ages of 9 and 17, then he may have already talked to her mother and asked permission to come a\'courting.',
			'Shortly after Trump was elected, I would have been horrified by the prospect of the batshit crazy candidates the GOP is putting up. Now, watching them being taken down in race after race is so satisfying that I hope they keep doing it. Trump has proven to the middle, the moderates and the sane that this illness is a genuine threat and must not be allowed to spread.',

			'Are you saying he showed up for Congress in DC?',
			'I really hope he did? But no I don\'t think he\'s THAT insane.',
			'It still matters, because it still poisons democracy. Going down with honor and thanking your supporters while wishing the best to the new guy gets things going on the right foot. Refusing to concede makes people more bitter and antagonistic. ',

You hire a couple of PI’s to dig as deep into their personal history as possible and see what they can turn up and how problematic it will be.

That past issues and problems would no longer matter, as long as the person was racist enough, and intolerant enough for the far far right base.  He took a gamble and he lost.

The value of what he knows will diminish day by day, particularly when others in the inner circle start dropping their own tell all’s (is there anybody who honestly believes Kellyanne Conway won’t be cashing in on a book deal the moment she leaves the WH?). It’s strange that nobody close to Trump has come forward to claim their millions in book royalties, especially since Trump does not even value loyalty and goes out of his way to publicly demean and destroy even people like Bannon, who mostly stay in line.',

Trump has already said things publicly that contradicted what he told mueller or such, kinda hazy. And we all know that they can\'t keep their stories straight or come up with plausible excuses, and that their stories change. So what\'s holding them back? ',
			'My take is that Mueller knows any recommendation he makes at the end of this will be highly scrutinized, so he\'s going to make sure whatever he presents is \'airtight\'.',

Going against Mueller\'s recommendation, if it is airtight impeachment, would be more serious than any of the shenanigans they\'ve pulled so far. I know a lot of democrats feel like we\'re in a constitutional crisis, but we aren\'t. Not yet. We will be if they protect him from a Mueller led indictment. Also remember: they are cowards. Judging Trump now makes them responsible... doing it after Mueller? They\'re no longer responsible. All they have to do is fall in line.',
			'I think you estimate the capacity for doublethink ',
			'I agree. I don\'t know what the outcome of this investigation will be. But even if it is an airtight recommendation to indict, GOP can just undermine Mueller\'s reputation. It\'s not that hard or surprising for Fox News to do that. And if Fox News says it, then half of the country will believe so.',

He\'s immune to prosecution while he\'s the sitting President. So the GOP controls both houses. If they want they can just be like, "Well ok sure, maybe he did a bit of colluding, and broke some laws in the process, and undermined our whole democracy. But still, we\'re just gonna do nothing." However in the face of actual airtight proof (even in absence of such a video) I\'d like to think even Republicans aren\'t that stupid. It would be political suicide.',

They defended Roy Moore, trumps own advisor has made up massacres to defend points, they didn\'t give the senate a chance to read the tax plan or even legibly write it down. those things and many many others should have been political suicide, i can\'t imagine a complicated case brought up by mueller will do anything or change anyone\'s mind who is supporting trump still ',
			'Right, I don\'t doubt that Trump\'s administration and all his remaining supporters will go down kicking and screaming. I can\'t imagine Trump gracefully resigning - after what we see over the next year or two, people will be extolling the (relative) grace and virtue of Nixon forever after. But those fanatics aren\'t the ones in need of convincing. It\'s the career politicians in the house and Senate. And they, while no less repugnant, at least are governed by self interest.  If Mueller truly presents a solid case, especially if it demonstrates treason (or anything resembling it), any politician who is still supporting the man will never be elected again. And so, they\'ll turn on him like sharks who sense blood in the water. Our job after that is to not forget that it took airtight proof before they grew spines, and vote then out anyways.',
			'I thought whether a sitting president is immune to prosecution was a point of debate.',
			'ockquote> He\'s immune to prosecution while he\'s the sitting President.  Huh. So Nixon was half right?',
			'I agree that Republicans in Congress won\'t impeach. Maybe if there\'s a huge amount of public pressure, but even then it\'s doubtful. It\'s actually in their political interest to cut ties with Trump. He\'s a "6\'2" 236 lb" weight around their ankles but they\'ll stick with him because pleasing their base is their top priority.',
			'Regular people don\'t have enough power and money to hire an army of lawyers to stall and poke holes on the accusation. Typically, they don\'t have powerful allies either - which will destroy your career if your accusation has any flaws (in the best case). Add to this that it\'s easy to accuse the accusation (the Judiciary) of interfering with the Executive power. To counter all this, Mueller and co. need an overwhelming amount of proofs and documents, to show without any doubts whatsoever that Trump is guilty. Yes, it\'s a slow process, but the alternative is a system that can be easily abused by politicians.',

			'Correct. You need a simple majority in the House and 67 votes in the Senate. But if the House votes for impeachment, we get to put Trump on trial. And if it\'s as obvious as it should be that he should be removed and the Senate does nothing, it\'s the death of Republicans in 2020.',

And that man would not ingratiate himself to a foreign power, especially one like Russia.  He knew about the dirty money floating around, but definitely didn’t have anything to do with “collusion”. He was focused on riling up the base and pushing a right-wing agenda. In fact, he was the most pure politician on that team.  Too bad his viewpoint is also insane. ',
			'I agree. Bannon\'s philosophy might be disgusting, but he really does believe it. He wants the existing structures of government to crumble as quickly as possible, and then for him and his ilk to be in charge of rebuilding from there. And his vision for the rebuilt America is just as pasty white as he is. And I mean, he appears to have stuck by that goal all along. He just never realized how erratic and uncontrollable Trump would be',

			'Based on Bannons grievances against Javanka, as described in fire and fury, he\'s going to describe in detail everything he knows about Kushner. Which includes details about the Trump tower meeting.',
			'I\'m not so sure Bannon will have too much to offer on the Trump Tower meeting other than an opinion. He wasn\'t really on the team when it took place.  He has however continually had comments about money laundering linked to him, but again, it\'s difficult to imagine what he actually knows, as it seems unlikely that Trump took him into the inner sanctum of his Organisations finances. He might be able to shed some light on Trump\'s plans should he have lost however I think your observation about the Javanka axis is likely true however, and again it comes back to Jared\'s data operation in San Antonio and the relationship with Cambridge Analytics. If the campaign has deployed botnets controlled by Russian groups to help get their message out, then you\'re starting to see evidence of conscious collusion',
			'In the book, Bannon also talks at length about a Trump family only meeting on air force one, in which even the lawyers hired to represent Trump against the special prosecutor were excluded from. This meeting happened after the story about Don Jr and the Trump tower meeting broke. In this meeting, the cover story that the Trump tower meeting was about "adoption" was decided on by Trump and family. Bannon then goes on to say this was the principals in Mueller\'s investigation conspiring to obstruct justice. If he testifies along these lines, Jarvanka is screwed.',
			'If a true retelling, Trump is stupid as hell - Trump Jr. released the email transcripts - why were they unprepared for the inevitable fallout? It just screams incompetence, which while unsurprising, is still fucking stunning. I\'m no genius and even I could have done a better job managing this cover-up. Jesus they\'re dumb.',
			'Kushner looks like he sheds skin seasonally',
			'What kills me is they had a subpoena locked and loaded before Bannon even set foot in the door. Subpoena means "under penalty". You need a judge to grant that. (edit: No you don\'t, see below) It means you\'re legally compelled to cooperate and tell the truth or else held accountable under the law for impeding a criminal investigation. You no longer have a choice unless you\'re looking for an excellent reason to be locked up for contempt of court. Call me nuts but I doubt Darth Bannon reeeeeaaaally wants to take it up the ass for Trump at this point. Why would he? He can fall on his sword, or he can sing like a canary and continue to be not-in-jail and able to sell his opinions and stories for more money than most of us are probably going to see in our lives. He\'s been turned out on his ass by his financiers, his own base at Breibart is turning against him having decided they\'d rather stick with Trump, and his dreams of being the man behind the throne have basically been shot in the back of the head point blank.  You can say lots of mean things about Bannon, but he\'s like Dick Cheney. Evil, yes, but certainly not an idiot. He\'s capable of reading the writing on the wall, particularly when it\'s all lit up in neon like it is here. If I were Trump I would be very very worried! Although I\'m not sure Trump is capable of being worried. He seems to still legitimately think he\'s doing an awesome job and is in no danger at all, which, uh... Well. It\'s impressive, in a way, I\'ll give it that.',
			'ockquote> You need a judge to grant that.  No. Or at least, not directly. You need a judge to empanel a federal grand jury, but subpoenas from that grand jury are issued by the federal prosecutor\'s office.  Source quote from Popehat.com article on the subject:  Let\'s talk about how federal grand jury subpoenas actually work. These days the U.S. Attorney\'s Office prints them from fillable pdfs. Given that we were still typing them when I left the USAO in 2000, they probably achieved this technical benchmark in 2012 or so. Assistant United States Attorneys — that is, snot-nosed punks like I was at twenty-six — issue a grand jury subpoena by filling it out, or more likely, asking their secretary to fill it out. Nominally, the subpoena is issued on behalf of the grand jury. But it is not by any stretch of the imagination, issued by the grand jury. The AUSA need not — and never does, in my experience — ask the grand jury for permission. When the target of the subpoena produces documents, most often the Assistant U.S. Attorney lets the case agent — some Special Agent of the FBI or DEA or whatever — hold on to them. ',
			'...On the one hand, semantics! On the other hand though yes you are right and I probably should\'ve worded that differently.',
			'From the Wikipedia article on grand juries:  United States law also provides for the formation of special grand juries. While a regular grand jury primarily decides whether to bring charges, a special grand jury is called into existence to investigate whether organized crime is occurring in the community in which it sits. This could include, for instance, organized drug activity or organized corruption in government. As provided in 18 U.S.C. § 3331(a), the U.S. District Court in every judicial district having more than four million inhabitants must impanel a special grand jury when requested by a designated official of the Justice Department.  For a special grand jury like this one a judge needs to impanel the grand jury, but by law the judge has NO CHOICE in whether to impanel a grand jury upon request by a designated DoJ official.',
			'First insightful reply, have an upvote. He will snitch, for shure, he will probably try to snitch as little as nesecerry to lot be thrown in jail, but he will be going in to that room without a lawyer, up against wolves that are much better at this game than him. The only chance he has to remain popular by his base is to make a show of grand jury resisting, that will get him Fame and popularity now, but who can tell what the Trump camp looks like in 18 months, and if they remember him (prison solidarity has historicaly been much stronger on the left) He will snitch, he is a weak man without the spine that grand jury resistors need',
			'The way I see it, the only way for Bannon to regain any credibility with his base supports is to take down Trump. He helped create the monster, but then realized too late that he couldn’t control him and, oops, now Trump is the more powerful one and Bannon is a foot note. His only option if he wants to claw back his pre-Trump position is to paint himself as a freedom fighter who realized Trump was a phony, but is now fighting to expose his lies so he can support someone who truly shares his values. Of course, this is all dreams and wishes so who knows...',
			'He tried to do that at Breibart but kinda hedged his bets by saying he was going to "war" with the establishment around Trump instead of Trump himself.  They bought it for a little while.

And, welp. Here we are.',

Actually, maybe it was the prosecutors who chose their moment and felt he may be less likely to protect Trump after what happened. Trump is such an idiot.

Out of that group flies a small black cylinder with a parachute. It strikes the TC\'s side of the windshield of an SUV and detonates (it\'s a soviet era parachute submunition shape charge). Takes the head off of the senior Pesh, and wounds everyone else inside. The gunner in the GMV following instinctually turns his turret on the crowd, but does NOT give the kids a hate burst. Kids scatter. No one is apprehended. Dude is dead and others severely injured. But we\'re immoral killers apparently. Edit: fat fingers on little phone ',

I\'m referring to the war started in 2003, but even before then under Saddam\'s rule things were messed up. When you\'re forced to not only survive but attempt to thrive in a war zone, your standards for things like "right" and "wrong" change, as well as your threshold for trauma.  A little closer to home, this is one of the reasons that individuals raised in abusive homes will often find themselves in abusive relationships over and over again. When your standard for what you consider decent treatment is someone not outright stabbing you, because you grew up being beaten or raped regularly, you don\'t think that someone checking your phone or telling you not to talk to your friends a month into the relationship is a red flag. You will tolerate treatment that others would walk out on, because it pales in comparison to what you\'ve experienced and grown accustomed to.  If you grew up seeing people around you getting shot and blown to bits, hearing bombs go off and accepting people in uniforms barging into your house with guns, how much of a stretch is it to be the one holding the gun?

Unfortunately SSG knew what was happening seeing tears streaming down the kids face as an adult man had strapped an explosive vest on the kid and told to run into US patrol and detonate the device killing as many soldiers as he could. He never stopped looking at the kid as everyone was asking for an order on what to do their sights trained on the little boy. SSG said he thought of his little boy back home and how he thought he was going to die that day. As luck would have it for the patrol but not the little boy, the boy had tripped on a small berm and the device prematurely detonated at that spot. SSG told me that he watched every second up until the explosion and even afterwards. Sometimes even now that he looks into a scope he says he can see an outline of a shadow lingering, he said it was like you stare at the sun then look away and have that bright spot that takes time to disappear but this was the polar opposite, never a full figure but small enough to know that it wasn\'t an adult.

I mean, you could argue that anything is reusable as basically any inert material (e.g. most plastics, with PVC as an exception) can be re-purposed for something. Moreover, just because somethings recyclable doesn\'t mean it will be recycled. SEA produces billions of highly recyclable PET bottles every year and some of these still make their way into the ocean. Also, organic polymers are an inapporpriate technical solution for the current issue for many reasons which I will list here: They are inherently disposable (material value is lost and not regained); organic polymers are made from vegetable starches, which if scaled to account for even a small amount of the plastic currently used, lets say 10% of the ~300 million tonnes used annually, would place unnecessary pressure on already strained food production systems; and the production of these organic polymers is heinously expensive. ',
			'Wow, good response. So when you say:  composting is a net GHG emitter  You don\'t mean the actual composting itself, right? It\'s the production of compostible packaging that\'s the issue.',
			'Both. Landfills are very large emitters of GHGs (SO2, CH4, CO2), this is primarily because organic waste, as a proportion of total, has drastically increased in recent years. When you couple that with the embodied emissions (all carbon costs associated with production) present in the bags themselves its hardly worth it.  I probably shouldn\'t have used the word composting, its actually closer to digestion. ',
			'So I go back to my original question. Forests and gardens are full of organic waste. Are they also contributing to GHG\'s? What about at-home composting of banana/onion peels and such?',
			'The problem is plastic used in wrapping are hard to recycle. First off, few places collect it, secondly, it\'s used as throw away and it\'s light, so people tear through it to get to what they actually want, and a lot just gets blow away or just thrown (kill these people) into the environment. The film sealing a tray of raw chicken, I don\'t want to wash that, I want rid of it as soon as possible, and I recycle more than anyone I know. The solution doesn\'t have to be we swap 100% for organic polymers and carry on as we are. We can package differently and use other material, like more paper and cardboard.',

			'That or make the things reusable. Plastic in food packaging is fair because it is safe, clean and you can reheat things in it. But throwing it away instead of collecting and reusing it is the real problem. One possibility would be to make a set of standardized containers specified by an authority, with some dedicated space to attach printed text. They would be collected everywhere before being cleaned and sent back to businesses. By standardizing, you can avoid the main problem of consigned containers, which is the fact that you need to send it back to the same place it came from. But I don\'t know if the cost of collection and cleaning would make it worth while at the current prices. If taxes on them increase a lot maybe.',

I would say the biggest issue is not enough pla nor pva plants with high enough throughput to handle any sort of demand. Demand is growing though, and that\'s why some Petrochemical companies are constructing new plants. You\'ll never build a plant if you have no one to buy your product. But good news, it\'s changing and people do want it. I know Total is building one in Taiwan for pva, or maybe pla, can\'t recall right now. People are also moving away from pp. Last i heard Cokes PP plant in Brazil has been shut down for years. Totals pva plant Should be up and running within a decade. If we don\'t see any delays with this project then I\'d say it\'s a safe bet that the demand is still there and growing, and we\'ll see pva replace some aspects of consumer goods.  Just remember, the amount of PP and PE is thousands of times more than pla or pva used.  On a side note: Commodity plastics wouldn\'t have such a bad reputation if everyone who used them disposed of them correctly.

My mom used to work at a place that made tarps or something. Well some days she would come home with extra tarp material (like a rubber material in a way) that was excess or a mistake they would cut and would throw away or something. She took some of that and made some really nice bags out of them. Mainly used for swimming cloths/towels in the summer.

Normally, we lose heat through conducting it to the atmosphere around us and by radiating it. On Mars, that first mode is almost completely negated due to how thin the atmosphere is. And with less heat leaving the body, it\'ll feel much warmer than it would on Earth with the same temperature.',

		title: 'Dads in Sweden took more paternity leave than ever in 2017: Sweden offers 480 days of parental leave per child which can be shared out between mothers and fathers as they see fit, but with each parent entitled to at least three use-it-or-lose-it months. ',
		ments: [
			'Sounds like a good idea to me. I\'d hope that this will let new fathers bond better with their children. And maybe give the new mothers some respite. ',
			'So 480 days per child. That would mean I would get a total of 2400 days of parental leave. That\'s over 6.5 years. Does that apply only if both parents are working or even if one is a stay at home parent?',
			'Maybe not 100% accurate but you get 480 days shared between the parents. And the money you get is based on the income of the parent that is taking paternity leave. And if you are inemployed you get some minimum subsitute. This means that it\'s beneficial moneywise to let the parent with the lowest income to stay at home If you have income you get 80% of your income but maximum 952 SEK per day. You must have worked for at least 240 days in a year If you had less income than 117 590 SEK in a year you get 250 SEK per day. EDIT: Added more information',
			'ockquote> This means that it\'s beneficial moneywise to let the parent with the lowest income to stay at home.  Swede here, I don\'t quite follow your reasoning. The minimum is a small sum, you\'d get much more money from the government than the minimum gives if the highest payed used the days, but ofc it doesn\'t cover 100%. You mean overall right? In a scenario where both parents stay home though like the first month or two after the baby is born it\'s better if the highest payed uses their days. We also got more money the more equally if the days are split between the parents, not sure if that\'s still the case.  You get the same amount of days regardless if you\'re working or not. (for people wondering). I still don\'t understand how Americans handle it, they\'re expected to get back to work weeks after the baby is born right? How\'s that even possible, who watches the baby?',
			'I think most Americans save up their paid sick leave and use that for about, oh, 7-14 days. If you are well off, a mother and father can get by with one income, for at least 3 months, which is the minimum age babies can go to most daycare centers. If you are \'\'poor\'\' enough to get food stamps (keep in mind, its about 15% of the US population), you are likely to get other benefits as well-- such as money (its not much, a max of $400 a month for two people, i.e.., a single mom and a baby) and a housing voucher, AKA HUD. This depends on where you live, average price of rent, etc, and is sadly the reason many \'\'projects\'\' form in most cities. If you have average income, not well off or poor enough to get benefits, most Americans have family or friends babysit. All is all, its a goddamn disaster.  Edit: Used better words. ',
			'Many employers will also add 10% or so to that.',
			'OK that makes more sense. Thanks for the clarification.  Here in the US I don\'t know of many companies that give paternity leave. I get 10 calendar days for being active duty military.',
			'I know AT&T does (or did for my brother who worked there. He worked in the offices) (He used paternity leave to get snipped. He got 3-4 days off if I remember correctly)',
			'If you\'re out of the job market completely, you don\'t have a registered insurance income ("SGI") and you will only get a basic amount of money. If both parents had jobs before having children, you have 390 days to dispose at the "SGI" of the parent on leave, and 90 days at a nominal (250 SEK/day) level. Many parents with average or better income dilute their days a factor 5/7 by not getting reimbursed for Saturdays and Sundays. In this way, you get less money per month, but your parental leave can be extended by 40%. This way, 390 days can become more than 1,5 years of compensated leave.',
			'Yup, children here are allowed to go to daycare at 1 year of age, not before, so it covers it until then. The minimum isn\'t a ton of money though but it\'s better than nothing.  We also get $150 per child/month until they\'re 16 from the government (they raised it this year), it\'s called "barnbidrag", "child-aid" is a rough translation. Everyone gets it regardless of income. We don\'t have to pay for college either. Being a parent in Sweden must be a lot easier than being a parent in other countries...',
			'I am so happy we have this system. It\'s not just for the parents, it\'s for the kids. Research suggest that children become better adults by having close relationships with their parents, including fathers (two parents who spend time with them is connected to higher performance in school as well as lower risk of becoming criminals). The parental leave simply gives parents the opportunity of bonding with their children while they are young.  The main protest tends to be from people who want a more traditional family setup, where the mom gets all the leave. Complaints about how parent B (usually the father) can\'t take any time off due to work (this is usually presented by the mother), and they are therefore getting punished by not being able to take out the full 480 days.  It shouldn\'t just give mothers some \'respite\', fathers should be as present as mothers in raising their children.',
			'Decent maternity/paternity leave is so important, but badly neglected in many countries (especially paternity).',
			'Yeah it\'s a shame, dads should get a chance to bond with their newborn and the baby benefits so much as well',
			'Don\'t I wish. I\'m a contractor and will get zero maternity leave. I\'ll probably take two days off and go back to work. ',
			'wish I\'d have moved to sweden to have kids...',
			'Someone remind me again how much paid paternity leave Dads are entitled to in the United States.',
			'Who cares. I don\'t like kids, my gf and I never want kids, and I\'ll never understand why everyone equates breeder\'s rights with women\'s rights. Employers are just going to refrain from hiring people who are more likely to have children. Or people like myself will pay for it. I don\'t mind investing money in other people\'s children, it makes perfect sense, but let\'s not go overboard; let\'s remind ourselves that not everyone wants kids and some people cannot physically have kids. Also, let\'s address the obvious implication that "the US should do this too." If such a policy were implemented here in the US the economy would collapse. Everyone would pump out children. Hiring practices would change and certain companies would go down. We aren\'t like Swedes. If we\'re offered something free then people lunge at it with foamy mouths. I see it every single day.',

			'As is often the case, it may not be "the solution" but it is a piece of it. How small or big a piece it is we\'ll have to see.',

A lot of these people may live in an area where they only hear the teachings of one or two imams. If a kid only has one imam for his whole childhood, he\'s pretty prone to indoctrination. But if there\'s two imams and one preaches peace, the kid has options and is more likely to choose the more pleasant interpretation.  Normally raising awareness is overblown, but in this case it really does mean something for people to say "there\'s another way."',

			'It\'s not so much about Religiosity or Ideology at this point. It\'s about destabilizing nation states. This is now a strategic goal. Suicide bombing is merely a cheap way to do it effectively.  Management of Savagery argues that carrying out a campaign of constant violent attacks (vexation operations) in Muslim states will eventually exhaust their ability and will to enforce their authority, and that as the writ of the state withers away, chaos—or "savagery"—will ensue.[2][6] Extreme violence is emphasized.',

It was still allowed in Islam because Allah was choosing the time and place of your death. What changed was when an Egyptian cleric(which is Sunni) said that suicide bombing was allowed against Israel because everyone serves in the military so no one is a civilian. This was a radical change and against the doctrine of Islam. Now you would choose yourself what Time and place you die, instead of god doing it.

			'Considering how Islam actually works Clergywise, I don\'t know. Islam doesn\'t have a central organisation like Christian Churches. If you are Male, post pubescent, and a Muslim, you can become an Imam, you don\'t need to sign up to a central organisation and follow any rules outside of the Quran and local laws, you can just say "I\'m an Imam and leading this prayer" and if people are okay with that, you do that. The people in question here are, Ulema, Islamic Scholars who have taken proper courses in the corpus of Islamic law including The Quran, Hadith (recollections of things Muhammad said and did), and past rulings, fatwas and traditions from prominent and learned scholars. They are not like the Imams, these people go to seminaries to become Ulema. These are the people who issue Fatwas. Fatwas aren\'t small tweetlike pronouncements, they can be full books within themselves. They make a statement about an issue and back it up with citations from the Quran, Hadith, and other bits and bobs that are accepted into Islamic canon. Now the Ulema aren\'t like Bishops, they have knowledge of islamic law and have earnt degrees and qualifications which thus prove their authority, but they have no power over Imams. If an Imam doesn\'t agree with a Fatwa, they can just ignore it. They may lose a debate with them but they can just ignore them. If the Imam is linked to a certain organisation or group of Mosques or a particular university or even country where the Fatwa was issued or supported, they may support it.  For example, Imams in Pakistan or in the Pakistani Diaspora will be likely to support this, but an Imam in, say, the KSA, might not. A Salafi Imam may support Fatwas issued by the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia (where Salafism has it\'s centre and where it is the ruling religious group), but not support one issued by a Ulema from another Fiqh (group of Jurisprudence). In short, Eeehh, Islam is so damn decentralised it\'s hard to know.',

			'Well Pakistan denies any involvement in those attacks',
			'and on Afghanistan.',
			'And they\'re right ! Good call ! We should stand with that',
			'Well of course, suicide bombings have always been against the Koran.  Suicide bombings kill indiscriminately, and you can\'t kill Jews, Christians or fellow Muslims. Jews and Christians are "Children of the Book" and not subject to jihad in the first place, and killing a fellow Muslim basically... well it\'s not good: "But whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment." Suicide is wrong and you will not go to heaven if you kill yourself. "And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful." Suffice it to say, there\'s enough verses that Muslims who read their Koran should know that people who commit suicide will basically burn in hell forever. “Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be in the Fire of Hell, throwing himself down therein for ever and ever. Whoever takes poison and kills himself, his poison will be in his hand and he will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron, that piece of iron will be in his hand and he will be stabbing himself in the stomach with it in the Fire of Hell, for ever and ever." It defeats the whole point of jihad. The whole point of jihad is that people are supposed to reject polytheism and embrace "one god". When a person is engaging in jihad, they have to individually offer the chance to convert and only when a person refuses are you allowed to kill them. It\'s basically a duel to the death, except your "seconds" can join in.  Any good Muslim should know that suicide bombings are wrong, explicitly disallowed, and "un-Islamic".',
			'Your first two points are right but the third is not, jihad is only for defending Islam, like if a group is actively forcing Muslims to stop practicing then they can fight for their right to religion. To convert someone by threatening their life is not allowed at all and for someone to be Muslim they must make the decision themselves without pressure from anyone/anything else.',
			'The last point implies I can kill someone just for refusing to accept Islam. Your last point is completely wrong. I can kill someone in a war for refusing to surrender (which would usually mean they choose to join the Muslims after surrender) but I can\'t just start a war for no reason. There are rules when violence is allowed but there is no compulsion for someone to change their religion to Islam.',
			'Your main point is made.  I still read that and think wow that’s fucking mental though how could you believe in it. People say religion etc is all about love, forgiveness and acceptance but all I read is vengeance and hatred for those dissimilar.  Maybe I’m a filthy atheist though ',
			'Well, there are many other verses in the Koran that basically say that you should love other people and not kill them, etc. Every religion preaches either the Gold or Silver rule (gold = do good to other people, silver = don\'t do bad stuff to other people), so all in all I think religion in general can be helpful, in my personal opinion.',

			'Emphasis on \'in the country\'.',
			'The issue is that while the vast majority of Muslims do not condone this violence that doesn\'t really make them "moderate Muslims" Conservative Muslims generally hate the terrorists and dislike the moderates. The problem is that conservative Muslims (who hate gays, want to punish apostasy/blasphemy, ect) are a breeding ground for values that lead to terrorism. The cleric who preaches that "Western" ideals are corruptive might not advocate violence but he does spread the idea that there is a problem even if he and a terrorist disagree about how to solve that problem (as apposed to the moderate Muslim who doesn\'t see something like freedom of religion as a problem).',

			'I know it is mixed and that they do not like each other (!!). Aren\'t there a number of self-professed clerics as well? Actually, come to think about it, I know zilch about how one goes about becoming an imam, if that word is appropriate Are there, like in the US, seminaries and street preachers? I have kind of thought the Shiites were more like Protestants, like anyone can preach and be touched by god and that the Sunnis were more formal, more like Catholics in that there is an, ahem, certain way things are supposed to be done.',
			'ockquote> I know zilch about how one goes about becoming an imam  If you are an adult male muslim, lead prayers and call yourself an Imam you are an Imam. Clerics refers to people who have a formal education in Islamic matters and history. There is no centralised system of power however and the only thing a cleric can do to convince an Imam to follow a fatwa is make a really good argument. The Sunni-Shia divide is complicated but it\'s core is centered around the succession after the death of the Prophet Mohammed. The TL;DR version is that:  Sunnis think Abu Bakr (the father of Aisha the Prophet\'s wife) was the rightful successor. Shias think Muhammad divinely ordained his cousin and son-in-law Ali Ibn Abi Talib to be the next Caliph. With Aisha\'s support Abu Bakr followed Mohammed as Caliph. Ali Ibn Abi Talib did not contest this and was to loyal to Abu Bakr and the next two Caliphs (Umar ibn al-Khattab and Uthman ibn Affan) The third caliph Uthman ibn Affan was assassinated Ali Ibn Abi Talib was elected as the fourth caliph. Ali chose to let sleeping dogs lie in an attempt to ease all the bad blood. but Aisha opposed Ali at Basra (she wanted justice for the assassination of the previous caliph). Aisha\'s forces were defeated and she was escorted back to Medina.  That battle marks the beginning of the true Sunni-Shia divide but of course it also started earlier in the reign of the 2nd and 3rd Caliphs who opposed Ali\'s increasing power and the following millenia and a half of separation has led Sunni and Shia to very different interpretations of the Hadiths.

			'The Nature v Nurture topic is frustrating for me. The underlying mechanics of your specific wiring is what is important. You come into the world being dealt a hand of cards. You have no choice in it and your options are limited to what that hand will allow you to do. So all your life experiences (learning, tragedy, love etc) are affecting you but only within the context the cards will allow. It is giving you a preset number of possible outcomes. If we have the ability to choose our own cards that changes everything. Hell, despite what the theologians claim, we may eradicate the vast majority of human evil with an advanced biofeedback exercise we take as children. Who knows?',
			'But certain experiences or events can greatly alter a person’s thinking. For example, someone who suffers something awful like abuse or rape may have physiological problems down the line. For example, it’s not uncommon for child molesters, sexual predators, or abusive individuals to have experienced abuse when they were younger. What about a soldier suffering from PTSD after war? What about a marriage or relationship ending poorly resulting in person being unable to trust others or remain faithful themselves? What if a disease causes mental instability or clouds one’s thinking/judgement? What about drug abuse/addiction? Stress from work, home life, or financial matters? All these things aren’t natural and instead are actually life experiences that often make us the people we are today. Some handle it better or worse than others. Some of these people, for all we know, start out completely “normal” by all regards but have their wiring greatly altered after a traumatic experience or event in their lives.  Do I think some people are evil or wired to cause harm from the day they are born? Personally, I do think that there are unfortunately some people in this world who are just simply born and wired that way. But I also believe a lot of people are also born “normal” but from life experiences, upbringings, or teachings become these horrible monsters. If you ask me personally, I think it’s both nature and nurture that results in the type of people we end up.',

If your cards dictate you are very susceptible to rage and something bad happens to you, rage will most likely result.

			'That\'s not necessarily true. You don\'t mingle with the average population - you mostly mingle with your peers. If you go to engineering college and then get an engineering job - most of your friends are going to be engineers. ',
			'Except that only 20% of people with an IQ in the gifted range manage to make it to higher education. Most gifted kids and adults end up performing way under the level you would expect based on their IQ. So a lot of them don\'t end up being surrounded by peers. ',
			'Probably because school is daily, legally-required pain for them.',
			'More likley they lack another aspect to thier personality, such as motivation or drive. The most successful engineers I ever met were definatley not the smartest, they were simply the ones that put in the work.',
			'It\'s a very common problem for people with high IQ to lack motivation or drive, however, it\'s often due to the school system not being designed for them. Imagine having learned how to read at 3, then at 6 they will teach you the letters, slowly. Imagine understanding basic math at 5, and then having to sit through hours and hours of + - * /. In addition, gifted children often have problems socializing with kids their age because they have different interests, know more things, and speak in a more grown up way. Together, this means that these kids are bored, and their reward for nailing everthing the teacher gives them, is to get more homework! So when they don\'t have to work for anything, and when they do work, they get punished with more work, and it\'s all to easy and not stimulating, no wonder they get disillusioned. So many of these kids gets diagnosed with adhd or something because bored kids don\'t want to sit still. They often drop out of school, start on drugs, etc. Many do make it though, however, with no work ethic to speak of, many can\'t finish school because eventually things get harder. For example, an earlier boss of mine, dropped out of high school, with an adhd diagnosis. Built boats. Suddenly got inspired by an old professor to do something, took entire high school in one year, all A\'s. Then medical school in a couple of years, all A\'s. I\'ve met a lot of these people, some managed, some didn\'t, and they all have similar stories to tell. A friend of mine works to better conditions for these children, and listening to what he says, it\'s really surprising how much the school system opposes also lifting out the gifted ones and tailoring a curriculum to their levels.',
			'most likely are socio-economic factors (assuming highly intelligent people have some fatal, natural flaw is completely baseless, by the way.) your IQ doesn\'t care much about how much money your parents had...but everything else does, right down to how good your grades were in school and whether or not you can even get into a college, let alone afford it. not only that but the socio-economic status and educational attainment of your parents is a better predictor of your life success than any other factor.',
			'Which group occurs in greater numbers, engineers or people of average intellect? If your peer group gives you few choices and you find only one friend or less, isnt that a bit depressing?',
			'ockquote> Which group occurs in greater numbers, engineers or people of average intellect?  That was my point. If you go to college with engineers and work with engineers then you are more likely to be friends with a bunch of engineers. It doesn\'t matter which group is larger, what matters is which group you are closer to and you like spending time with. ',
			'Seems like what he was getting at is that it\'s slim pickins and you won\'t end up with many friends.',
			'I wasn\'t saying that you intentionally restrict yourself to just "engineers". Just that you are more likely to be around them and thus they are likely to form a bigger part of your friend circle. And it\'s likely true with anyone. Arn\'t cops more likely to be friends with other cops?',
			'But the engineer with the high IQ still needs to keep his damn mouth shut or else he will get ostracized and ridiculed just the same.  IME, smart folks are much less accepting of “brilliant” people than average joes are. ',
			'Second the fuck out of that. Average joes will often just accept that you\'re smart, "brilliant" ones will pretty often go out of their way to out-smart you, especially if the discussion\'s on a topic they know about.',
			'I think his point was rather the opposite: not that "brilliant" people are \'I am very smart\' types, but that smart people who understand they are intelligent feel threatened by people who truly are brilliant and are much smarter than them. Which probably makes sense if they\'ve spent their life as one of the "smart ones" to suddenly find themselves in a position of ignorance.',
			'I can definitely see that too. Just, in my experience, most of the really smart people have been that way their entire lives, so they\'re like your second line.',
			'Not true, source: me I went to engineering college, got an engineering job and have one friend who\'s an engineer.',
			'Anecdotal evidence (mine included) is not really of much help either way which is why I used the term "necessarily true". I also went to engineering college and all of my closest friends are my old college buddies. The rest are from work or childhood friends. ',
			'Nor does it have to be either or, and I guess I myself actually represent the middle ground. I am a Software Engineering graduate student, and roughly half of my friends are people I\'ve known since undergrad and the other half consists of childhood friends and gaming buddies. Although I don\'t have any proof of it, I would believe most people have multiple sets of friends like I do, that they know from different contexts, with whom they have specific common interests be they professional or personal.',
			'ockquote> That\'s not necessarily true. You don\'t mingle with the average population - you mostly mingle with your peers. If you go to engineering college and then get an engineering job - most of your friends are going to be engineers.   A world of colleagues but no friends.',
			'It was probably the quickest way to find people that "qualified" for their study. The alternative might be posting an ad and getting replies from thousands of unqualified redditors.',
			'I agree with that partially. I have seen that kind of behaviour as well for a certain group of high IQ people (we don\'t have Mensa here, but I have experience with a different group). And I agree these people are pretty focussed on their IQ\'s an not much else and especially the meetings tend to draw in people that are ehm... a bit perculiar.  But that does not mean the research does not have some of truth to it. And from my personal experience, where a high IQ is something that \'runs in the family\' (I have at least 7 members of my family in the highly gifted range) I can see numerous cases of comorbidity for autism, depression, anxiety and ADHD.  I have two gifted kids that I\'m trying to steer through their childhood, and I can tell you, the wiring in their heads is definitely different from people closer to the middle range. There have been times I have secretely wished they would be a bit more dumb so it would be a bit easier for them. My eldest was basically born anxious and my youngest was only seven when he wished himself dead because he was so depressed.  Being this smart is because your brain works different (not even better actually, just faster and with different pathways) so it is really not that strange this would have effect in other ways as well.  if you think about certain things more deeply >>> you get depressed if you overthink and work out every different outcome, because your brain just keeps on jumping to the next posibility >>> you get anxiety if your neurons fire more rapidly, making everything quicker so you want to respond to all of that >>> you get ADHD if your brain is very susceptible to input and gets so much input at once that it just kind of freezes from all those posibilities and you feel overwhelmed >>> you get autism  It does not sound really surprising that these things are linked imo.

Anyone who\'s remotely a threat could be killed off in minutes. Once we\'re in that kind of system, there\'s no way out.  If we eradicate enough bees and other pollinating insects we lose 40% of all food on Earth, every flower and every fruit or vegetable that requires pollination will be gone forever.  Once AI pass the Turing test we will most likely have softwarebots indistinguishable from other humans spreading messages online, capable of influencing and radicalizing massive amounts of humans easily. Combine that with our current knowledge of human behavior and all the data available programs can search out the individuals most prone to violence throughout the world, make them believe they\'re surrounded by peers and cause them to commit atrocities.

If Hitler had several thousand nukes by the time Berlin fell and he was ready to kill himself, he probably would have set them off. If you don\'t feel empathy the lives of others mean nothing, it could be as simple as doing it from sheer spite since death is certain anyway.  China is getting a citizen score, basically software that\'s going to go through people\'s messages and determine who\'s a model citizen and who\'s not. Take the first thing I wrote, minus the armed drones. They\'re going to expand at some point if they keep advancing the way they have, and that system will effect more and more people.  Once computers get fast enough they\'re going to be able to bruteforce their way past any encryption. That would make any password useless, and all our bank accounts and all other accounts would be "open".  Automation is going to increase unemployment to unsustainable levels, if that\'s not somehow combated through higher taxes and redistributed to the unemployed our markets will crash. No one will have enough money to spend, wares won\'t get sold.  Once we stoo using books completely history, news, facts, everything can be edited by the ones with the most computational power. 1984 in essence. We also have global warming and the fuckton of problems stemming from that. Yellowstone (supervolcano) is going to erupt at some point as well, from what I\'ve heard it\'s going to cover our skies in ash, dropping the global temperature immensely and killing off vegetation. I don\'t know much about it though since it\'s an unavoidable event. It\'s low priority for me since we can\'t stop it anyway.  I hope people make it to Mars and Titan and everywhere else we can get them because at some point in the future of our species this planet is going to become uninhabitable for nearly all humans. I hope we\'ve colonized other regions of space before that happens. If nothing else, the sun is going to consume Earth at the end of it\'s life, although that\'s extremely far away from now.  This list could easily be made ten times longer but this is Reddit and it\'s rude of me to even write this much. But yes, it keeps me up at night. Anyone else want to add anything to this?',
			'I understand. The problems humanity must overcome in the future has made me jaded in its priority. In 5 billion years the sun will begin using its last source of fuel - helium - causing it to expand and engulf the entire Earth whole. If humanity isn’t off by then - everything we’ve overcome and accomplished as a species will all be for nothing.  A.I is the key to helping us solve the barriers we defined in physics. How can we travel to far away stars when the speed of light itself is grandma speed? Well... we can ask A.I to code other A.I to solve it for us - but we must regulate it.  I wonder about the impact many of us could have so long as we had the capital. Billionaires could feed millions, education could be abundant, medical care wouldn’t be seen as a burden. I’ve seen the power that capital can have because the value of money is the best means of influence. But the way the system is - it’s given and made easy to obtain to the greedy and the few that have many - with an excuse given that people can do whatever they want with their money. It makes me wonder - what good is wealth when you don’t spend it accordingly? Why increase your bank account to absurd amounts of capital that would be sustainable for generations if all you ever do is hoard it? The companies that could be started up - the impact that could be done to better and further humanity. Yet all of it is locked behind the individuals who have benefited the most with their intentions being less than nothing.  It burdens me how powerless I feel sometimes. Hence my focus on gaining as much capital as I can through my career trading stock equities - hopefully to eventually gain the means needed to actually improve what our ancestors failed to or were misguided to do. It sounds cringy - it may sound edgy given the context of this headline where redditors here think I’m trying to act like something I’m not. I’m genuinely trying but I feel burdened. It’s led me to depression and suicidal thoughts. But I’m still trying. I know there are others who see what I do - and how they must feel like I do. ',

			'"but maybe life on Earth could be Heaven - doesn\'t just the thought of it make it worth a try..."  and yea - someone recently asked me what was so wrong with my life to contribute to depression/anxiety, and it wasn\'t what was screwed up in my life that I was sad about, it\'s the number of other screwed up lives that I know are existing in the real world as we speak. For some reason, my go-to example is always something like: "out of 7billion people in this world, someone, somewhere, is chained inside a basement right now and being tortured and abused in ways a normal human couldn\'t imagine." And sure enough, that story about the California couple with ~12 kids malnourished and chained to their beds with padlocks goes viral. I mean yea, it\'s a fucked-up example, but it makes me self-aware of every smile, every laugh, every good feeling that I experience day-to-day and realize someone somewhere else is being completely deprived of every single positive feeling I\'m going through. Add that to my own awareness of my idle time and my own feelings of negativity, and it\'s like wtf do I have to be upset about? Queue conflicting feelings of being angry about being sad but then being sad that I\'m angry - then switching back to depressing empathy towards a hypothetical victim. I\'m fortunate alcohol is my worst vice as of now. Anywho it kinda just goes to the validity of HST\'s statement "It\'s a strange world - some people get rich and others eat shit and die" ',

If you are selective then you have a distorted view of the world, which is considered less intelligent because it\'s more likely to be wrong about pragmatic outcomes and expectations.  People can be selective with a positive predisposition OR even a negative one. It\'s important not to conflate negativity with intelligence (as a rule) because that can just as easily push you into a corner that leaves you feeling or looking stupid.',

The show may reference math, science, or philosophical topics but you don\'t really need to be that familiar to know what is going on. Most of it is taken out of the realm of reality anyway, and the fact that the science is fiction is often poked fun at.  The fact that one of the title characters is a hyper-intelligent narcissist is thought to attract narcissists who think they are intelligent, though. If the expectation that the show be academically \'cerebral\' was holding you back from enjoying it, I\'d say adjust your expectations and give it another try. However, if the humor didn\'t appeal to you, the show might just not be for you, as the humor in that episode is pretty representative of the series. ',
			'Obligatory comment condescendingly explaining how it takes a full understanding of relativistic quantum mechanics to understand Rick and Morty I think people who enjoy it often identify with Rick--the blatant disregard for things he sees as unimportant, the feeling of being essentially alone in most of his pursuits (except for his undergrad... Er, Morty...) and the raging alcoholism that we attribute to his profound loneliness and pessimism. Much of the "intellectually stimulating" material is woven into the fast-paced, often improvised comedy of the show such that you have to really be paying attention to pick up on it. It\'s not always essential details, but it is enriching--people who see themselves as smart like this because they can feel that, like Rick, they\'re noticing something more than everyone else in the room. Anyway, I think this is a cartoon that appeals to people who like to feel smart, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s going to hit you over the head with jokes about, say, expressing serial numbers as the sum of two cubes... It\'s a comedy sci-fi cartoon, how cerebral could it be?',
			'Watch it as a comedy show, it’s nothing more and never ment to be more. only some part of it’s community said it was extremely intellectual, now people copy/past long message to laught about them it’s not intellectual by any means really',
			'I think it\'s less "intellectually stimulating" than just "not dumbed down". When they do a joke, they just do the joke. It\'s not necessarily a "smart joke", but they don\'t waste time narrating in background information for the joke into the show. &nbsp; e.g. When Jerry has his shotgun and says "I wish that shotgun was my penis." and Beth replies "If it were, you could call me Ernest Hemingway". The humor itself is just base toilet humor, but they just assume you get the joke and move on without treating you like a moron by also narrating an Ernest Hemingway suicide lesson earlier into the show. If, say, The Big Bang Theory did this joke, there would be a 2 minute discussion about Hemingway before delivering the joke.',

Now, he\'s doubled down on tyranny. If at any point in the future he tried to negotiate a truce, the world would be forced to hold him accountable for his crimes against humanity.

He maintains this externally by presenting a credible but stable threat that doesn\'t quite qualify as MAD, but with enough potential casualties that we don\'t want to play the game. Unfortunately, Trump is trying to up the ante, destabilizing the status quo. Now, many Americans would love to liberate the North Koreans, but we don\'t want to do so at the cost of widespread allied bloodshed. Also, it sucks that the North doesn\'t have the resources to keep their people fed properly. Nobody wants to press any buttons, but how in the hell do we fix this problem without killing too many people?',
			'I don\'t think that\'s the case. Un\'s current actions are all methodical. First, he eliminated everyone who could have a reasonable claim to replace him, or imprisoned them — uncle, brother, etc. Then he eliminated or imprisoned those within the state apparatus that opposed him. These steps are necessary to ensure he keeps having power for any future steps to take. Afterwards, he developed nuclear weapons to limit foreign influence. At the point he has reached now, he can actually start doing whatever politics he wants. To actually enact something, you need the political capital to do so, and need to ensure no one else fucks you over for it. With his previous steps, he did exactly what is required to get there. Now he is unchallenged, and we\'ll be able to see qhat he actually wants to do. At any previous point, if he had tried to change the state too much, he could have been assassinated and replaced for it — now he is safe to enact whatever he wants. So we\'ll see if he extends the brutal policies of his father, or if he remembers his youth in a swiss boarding school, and tries to go for more freedom. Everything until this ppint was brutal, but a political necessity in his situation. Had he for example worked towards democracy from day one, the military\'s generals likely would have killed him. Had he worked towards unifying with the south, or cooperating with China, he\'d also have been assassinated. He will have to be held responsible for the crimes against humanity he did, but honestly, there\'s little else he could have done in the past. That said, in the past months he has provided citizens slightly more freedom (e.g. allowing them to purchase property and start businesses in some regions, in limited ways), and he\'s talking with south korea regarding the Olympics. The true question is, what would you do if you were Kim Jong Un? Personally (you can check my comment history), I\'ve said for years that I don\'t see any path he could take towards freedom unless he first eliminates those who contests him, develops a way to guarantee MAD (e.g. through nukes), and then enacts his policies. Of course, whatever his policies are is now the scary, yet hopeful part.',
			'Those are all good points, and echo some of the thoughts rattling around in the back of my head, but I disagree where it came to developing the nukes. With his geography, he already has SK by the balls through the threat of conventional artillery. By taking the ball a step over the line, he\'s indicating to the rest of the world that he\'s not playing cool anymore. We can handle the international threats when there is an understanding that this is all a domestic dog and pony show to maintain power. Lobbing ballistic missiles over foreign territory is an actual threat, virtually an act of war. It\'s going to be a lot more impossible to be sympathetic under the given circumstances.',
			'Yes, that\'s a point I\'ve been thinking about a lot, but artillery against south korea is always limited in effectiveness, especially if an opponent would show up that does not care about losing Seoul (e.g., an unrational US president even worse than Trump).

It is taxed separately, and actually owns a huge amount of the debt of other parts of the United States government. Without that, we would have been downgraded a long time ago. Medicaid is similar. Both programs are solvent. Medicare, yeah, you\'ve got me there, that\'s going to be a huge issue. The fact that the US government is borrowing from these programs while maintaining huge deficits means that the US government is going to have to pay them back. That\'s going to be the real sticking point in the coming years, but it doesn\'t change the fact that SS keeps the US government solvent. They aren\'t the real problem: exploding medical costs, a shitty tax system for SS (the SS cap), modern Reagan-esque tax structures, and bloated military spending are the real issues, IMO. edit: I\'m bad at editing.',
			'Sorry what do you mean when you say SS has no effect on the national budget? I\'m including both non-discretionary and discretionary spending when talking about \'the budget\' My point is that while they may be currently solvent, the rapidly approaching demographic shift will quickly push them into insolvency. I agree the military spends incredibly inefficiently, but, pointless foreign wars aside, we get a lot of value per dollar spent in global influence. I can\'t see how you can make an argument that the department that only uses 16% of the budget is the main problem. We can\'t maintain deficits forever. We either need to spend less or raise taxes. I believe we should spend less. Nordic socialist countries are facing these issues as well and their citizenry is increasingly rejecting high taxes and voting for lower tax policies.  Also as a side note, I\'m no Trump fan, but it seems hypocritical to criticize him for a 1.3 trillion increase in military spending when most mainstream outlets were silent on the Obama administration blowing up the deficit by over 10 trillion. You have to be intellectually honest with the facts, otherwise you give ammunition to trolls and right-wing assholes. That\'s how Trump gained a foothold: there\'s a kernel of truth to a lot of what he says.

			'Not exactly. Budget sequestration was a trigger in a bill (signed by Obama) to deal with the debt ceiling issue.  Ultimately, the intent of the sequester was to secure the commitment of both sides to future negotiation by means of an enforcement mechanism that would be unpalatable to Republicans and Democrats alike. President Obama agreed to the plan. House Speaker John Boehner expressed reservations, but also agreed. On July 26, 2011, White House Budget Director Jack Lew and White House Legislative Affairs Director Rob Nabors met with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to discuss the plan. Reid, like Boehner several days before, was initially opposed to the idea, but was eventually convinced to go along with it, with the understanding that the sequester was intended as an enforcement tool rather than a true budget proposal ',
			'SS can be thought of as it\'s own entity in the government, as can most government programs, but here is where it is different from other government programs: it has it\'s own budget. When you think of government deficits and debts, they are actually part of general government expenditures, and general tax collection. It is this general bucket that has a deficit and debt. Some of this \'general bucket\' debt is bought by social security. See, social security is currently still running a surplus, and in it\'s own revenue collection scheme. It uses this surplus to buy debt and collect interest on it, as proposed by Allan Greenspan so many years ago, and it has been effective. Not effective to last another 50 years, but pretty damn effective. When I speak of the budget that congress passes every year, that has (almost) absolutely nothing to do with SS. SS is kinda sorta protected from that every year by the pure fact that it collects and pays out revenue out of a bucket that has nothing to do with general funding every year. So, yeah, it is part of the budget, when thought of in a very general way, but on the same token, it has nothing to do with the deficit/debt, other than the fact that it buys government debt because of its current solvency. When we reach a point where it is no longer actually solvent, I guarantee that we\'ll have far larger economic problems (population/automation/ecologic) and that we\'ll have to reorganize our entire economic system anyhow, or walk down the path of Elysium. So, I wouldn\'t worry about it too much.',
			'SS from a practical point of view does not really have its own budget since the funds are commingled with the rest of the treasury funds and even though it has run a surplus since its inception, that money is used to purchase US government bonds (indeed SS holds about 15% of total US bonds). Who has to pay back the bonds? The US treasury. Therefore as total US government debt builds it means the surplus that is supposedly invested in treasuries is really invested in debt and the actual tax revenue is spent with the rest of the tax revenues. So yes, there is a separate tax on your paycheck for SS and that money is ear-marked for the reserve fund, but then that money is just spent like all the other taxes. Here is the relevant language from the SS web site:  The Social Security Act provides that the funds are maintained “on the books of the Treasury.” The Treasury manages the Social Security accounts in much the same way that a bank manages a checking account: Accurate accounts are kept of the cash deposits and the accruing interest; cash (plus interest) withdrawals are allowed whenever needed; and in the meantime, the bank can put the cash to other uses. Thus, the Treasury uses procedures that fully and accurately account for the cash from trust fund tax income deposited with the Treasury and the interest that accrues on those deposits. Until the invested amounts are needed to pay benefits, the cash is intermingled with the Treasury\'s cash operations for the rest of the government. The size of the accumulated reserves is tracked by special Treasury securities. Those securities are issued to the trust funds both when cash from tax income is deposited and when interest is paid on the invested reserves. When Social Security benefits are paid, trust fund securities are redeemed for the cash to pay beneficiaries.  italics are mine to emphasize the practical result. So what that really means is the "ear-marked" funds in the reserve are converted into debt.  Incidentally, the language from the SS website makes a highly inaccurate analogy. When a bank takes your deposits and then invests the money, it will be paying you back with interest earned from the investments it makes (in mortgages, loans etc, made to outside entities). When the government takes your SS money the "investments" it makes are in its own bonds. That is a huge difference. ',
			'I disagree with the idea that it\'s a huge difference... unless you believe that the US government should/could go insolvent. Perhaps it is time that the SS funds start picking up different kinds of debt? The question is where to invest it, as nothing is officially safer than the US government debt, and if the US government were to default, we\'d be dealing with much larger issues than worrying about SS. I would argue that picking up some kind of government bonds are always the safest way. Perhaps not US government bonds, I really don\'t know... I do not consider the stock market a safe choice, as I\'ll bet it\'ll run into real issues whether or not the US government goes into default.',

The interesting comparison is to take the percentage spend of a governmental budget for a basket of European nations, and then see what the US spends for comparison. Last time I checked something like 24% of the US Federal budget went on public health, which compared to a western European spread of between 14% and 21% spanning Italy to the Netherlands The other area of large discrepancy is education.

			'To be fair, neither party fully enacts the policies of austerity (increasing taxes and cutting government spending). Both Democrats and Republicans have, and will continue to, enact policies that would increase the debt. Because what actually matters isn\'t the debt by itself, but the debt/GDP ratio. Both Republicans and Democrats generally agree that the debt cannot be managed, in a non-catastrophic way, without growing the GDP. They just have very different theories about how best to grow the GDP.  The common economic theory for Democrats, Keynesian economics (demand-side economics), makes them want to grow the GDP by via things like government stimulus; the government tries to spur economic activity where private actors are not doing so, to compensate for low private sector investment and low consumer demand with government investment, government employing people, and government purchasing from the private sector. This increases the debt in the short term because the government is spending more, but if it is successful at growing the economy enough, it improves the debt/GDP ratio.  Conversely, the common economic theory for Republicans, supply-side economics, makes them want to grow the GDP by cutting taxes and relaxing restraints put on over-regulated sectors of the economy. In theory, businesses will hire more, invest more, spend more, innovate more, and generally be less sluggish when less of their profit is going to the government. This also increases the debt in the short term by lowering government revenue, but if it is successful at growing the economy enough, it improves the debt/GDP ratio.',

			'their government-linked corporations as well as all local banks are bound to the rating agencies.  The same way some retirement plans are bound to only invest in AAA rated funds (not from the states so I dont know the actual terms for the US). Btw, some of these AAA-rated funds/instruments actually bought itself into the rating group, such as the toxic CDOs... they were AAA-rated but they should not have been. that caused the housing market crash which triggered the domino effects that bankrupted so many companies If you ask "can we trust the chinese rating agencies" i can ask "can you trust your own?"

			'So surely we should care what Chinese credit ratings have to say, right? EDIT: On another note, I had no idea that HSBC (British) was larger than any bank in the US. TIL.',
			'Yes you absolutely should care. China holds around 20% of total US foreign debt. As countries downgrade another countries credit ratings, they crank up the interest on that debt to counter the increased chance of default.  It\'s very much like an individual applying for a loan from a bank with a bad credit rating. They may still offer you the loan but you will be paying a higher rate of interest as a result.',
			'Not a good analogy because US Central Bank sets the bond terms so China cannot increase any interest from the debt. The credit rating from China is not useful in this context but it will lessen attractiveness of us debt.',
			'Yes that\'s true but if the US wishes to issue bonds that are marketable to global investors they will need to set the yields at attractive rates. If China is lowering the credit rating of the US they will look for higher yields.  America is going to have to issue even more debt to cover the deficits forecast as a result of Trumps tax plan. They will want the Chinese to buy this debt. They will need to offer better yields.',
			'They have already said they won\'t be buying new debt. Maybe let the short term debt mature and reduce holdings in LT debt. Other countries are certainly free to take up the slack though, if they are in a position to do so.',

			'That\'s not really true. China has been buying and selling US debt for years in order to manipulate currency markets. Mid-2017 they were buying, late-2017 they were selling again. This has allowed to China to devalue the Yuan, helping exports, in spite of massive growth. This has also allowed the US to keep interests rates low. If China starts selling US debt then America may find itself in an ugly position.',

In authoritarian countries, one way to tell what they are worried about is to see what they claim are problems in other countries. So when you get some rather odd statement like this one, we should interpret it to mean that the government is worried about its own debt and hopes that it can use deflection to keep anyone from noticing. None of this means that the debt in the U.S. is anything to be happy about.  ',

			'ockquote> And it\'s all based on a process that shouldn\'t even exist in the first place. Expenditures are already defined by Congress  No, shutdown doesn\'t happen because of the debt, it happens because the budget or the appropriate authorization act wasn\'t passed. It\'s in the Constitution that way on purpose.  No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.” ~US Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7  If there is disagreement over the budget bill or particular appropriations then the bills to fund them does not get presented for their votes, or simply fail their votes, or get vetoed by the President. This includes the authorizations bills and appropriations bills for the US Government to continue operations at all since they are paid by the Treasury, hence why if they don\'t pass their own budget bill and authorization acts and fund certain appropriations then things get shut down. They can instead pass a Continuing Resolution but that only allows previous year\'s funds, no increases or changes. Government employees are also prohibited from obligating the government without the appropriate authorization and appropriations being in place, under 31 U.S. Code § 1517, so when the Federal government fails to pass the bills funding itself for the new year all federal employees except those in critical positions have to stop working. It\'s total bullshit that the political parties use the need to pass the budget for political manipulation but in general I consider nothing too low for a politician to try if it means their seat or party gets stronger, so I guess we shouldn\'t be surprised.',

			'What? No. Government shutdowns occur when the Congress fails to agree to and pass a budget for a given fiscal year.  The tax bill has nothing to do with that. Will some funding be lost to certain areas? Probably given the likely loss of revenue, but it will not shut down the entire government. Furthermore, these shutdowns really only affect nonessential funding - things like national parks, certain kinds of grants and programs, but law enforcement, military, and basic services remain in place.  This is actually just this private, foreign agency declaring that they have a little less faith in the US government, which would make it more difficult for the US government to borrow more money. It\'ll probably affect the dollar negatively when compared to other currencies. But no, this will not directly lead to a government shutdown, nor are we likely to have one. Other credit agencies have degraded the US credit rating before, and it often has little effect other than generating a sensationalist headline.',
			'What? Yes. Government shuts down Friday without congressional action.',
			'Again, nothing to do with the tax bill or the credit rating being degraded. It\'s because Congress will not agree on a budget due to Trump demanding funding for his immigration policy, including the border wall. Most likely Congress will pass a temporary continuing resolution since both houses of Congress are under Republican control.',

The Chinese were, and still are, one of the biggest purchasers of US debt. This is a small but important indicator that the winds are changing. Likely there\'s some political push-back over the US\' trade spat with China, but it\'s clear that people around the world are nervous about unsustainable US policy, to say nothing of an irrational US leadership who neither understand nor care about global economics.

There you have a depression. Then if we keep voting repub because we are scared and go for austerity we will cut even more social programs only to realize social programs are a miniscule part of the budget.

Maybe, but the odds of that being sustained as the federal government prioritized social spending over defence and the US geared up for Vietnam wasn\'t great.

Also, do you really want your landlord to have the ability to report you to your credit bureau? I can think of a hundred and 10 ways this can get hairy.',

What that debt is for makes no difference, the simple fact that you would have a track record of paying back any debt is promising to someone who\'s about to let you take over their housing in exchange for promised rent. Trying to figure out that information from looking at your bank statements would be a nightmare for the average joe-blow property owner. At the end of the day, if you don\'t want to give that property owner a credit report you don\'t have to, you can just find somewhere else to live and he an find someone else who\'s willing to provide the report.

The landlord is the one that owns the house and the equity. It’s in his interests to protect his assets. That doesn’t mean he can’t be friendly his tenants though.  If you’ve bought and flipped houses why are you so worried about the rental market? You clearly have cash to buy a house as you have bought some before. Live in one of them and don’t answer to any landlord. ',
			'A guy with zero debt may never have had to pay for anything in his life? Maybe he\'s a sheltered rich boy who doesn\'t know how to work. A blank empty credit history with no outstanding loans is good if you\'re that person, but if you\'re renting to that person, a blank credit history tells you nothing about that person and their reliability. I find it hard to believe you regularly rent a property to people cause you seem to have zero perspective on what the process is like from a landlord POV. Seriously, instead of just saying meaningless platitudes like "we need to treat people like people and not number" explain to me how you expect a landlord to protect himself without a credit check? How is he supposed to "know" his tenant right off the bat? Guess what, some people lie. Shocking right? I would love to hear an answer. If you get stuck with a bad tenant, it can take upwards of 4-6 months to get rid of them. 4-6 months of non rent payments could be the difference between defaulting on your mortgage or not. The ability to rent someone else\'s private residence is not a human right, you\'re clearly entirely divorced from the reality of the world we live in. Nobody HAS to rent to you. ',

		ments: [
			'ockquote> (MOSCOW) — People living in some of the coldest places on earth are hunkering down as temperatures fall to near-record lows that are even defeating thermometers. Temperatures in the remote, diamond-rich Russian region of Yakutia on Tuesday plunged to minus 67 degrees Celsius (minus 88.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas. In Yakutia — about 3,300 miles east of Moscow — where students routinely go to school in minus 40 degrees, school was canceled throughout the region. Local police also ordered parents to keep their children at home. Over the weekend, two men froze to death when they tried to walk to a nearby farm after their car broke down. Three other men who were with them survived because they were wearing warmer clothes, local investigators reported on Monday. ',
			'I live where temps can get to -50C with windchill a few weeks out of the year, I can\'t fathom adding another 20 degrees colder to that. It literally hurts to breathe and frostbite occurs in minutes, this would have REALLY sucked.',
			'its crazy how a 5 min walk in -40 can really feel like a death march. ',
			'It doesn\'t feel like one, it is one.',
			'Unfortunately millions of people learned that fact :(',
			'I\'ve only experienced -20C/-4F in Sweden. Jesus Russia, I know I give you a lot of shit because of Putin but no one should have to have that kind of cold, my greatest sympathies :( I can\'t imagine it, I wouldn\'t want to experience it ever, not for a second. At -20C your nose freezes if you breathe in, below that... I can\'t imagine. I\'m sorry you have this kind of weather over there.',
			'I was in -40C for a while (but I think no windchill at all), and I thought it was strangely tolerable.  As in, it was bitingly cold, but it didn\'t feel as bad as say a windy day in NYC when it\'s -5/-10C.  NYC in the winter honestly felt pretty brutal, with the winds whistling between the buildings, whereas out in the central plateau in arctic circle Norway just felt strange.  When I went to the well to get water, which was covered to prevent freezing, the bucket would come up and I could feel radiant heat, from ~1C water.  I was with rescue guys. They said that (the Danish - all bad things happen to the Danish) would sometimes be found naked, because it gets so cold they start feeling warm.  Edit... I was so weirded out by how not insane -40 felt, I stood outside in a t-shirt for a few minutes. Didn\'t die. Yet I was out in -10 on the bike for a few hours and took about 2 hours to regain warmth.  Cold is strange. ',
			'I am definitely in a place where the cold is a "dry cold", so really the windchill is the thing that really has that bite to it. Coastal winters I think would be pretty bad though, because it is a wet cold which just penetrates your clothes and makes you miserable at much warmer temps than here.  Although -40 sucks regardless (having just got out of a week of it), my car can now go for a bit without having to be plugged in for fear of not starting.',
			'Right. The dry cold was wild, there was NO water in the air. Food did not get soggy, chips/crisps stayed crunchy.  The car thing was an issue. What we did was just pull the battery out and leave it in the house. That gave it a lot more cranking power, but the oil was still like treakle I\'m sure. I\'m not sure if it was -40 all the time either. I noticed that well after sun down.  I guess my point is, 0 is quite cool, -10 is pretty bloody cold, and then... -20 is strangely similar. It\'s somehow not like heat where things seem more linear.  I don\'t completely understand it. Although, full disclosure, I\'m from Ireland so I\'m not used to any sort of extremes.',

"Very recent research does suggest that persistent winter cold spells (as well as the western drought, heatwaves, prolonged storminess) are related to rapid Arctic warming, which is, in turn, caused mainly by human-caused climate change," Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at Rutgers University and one of the study\'s authors, said in an email.  According to this article and study, the extreme cold temperatures were predicted and that we can "expect that record-breaking cold events will occur less often in the future but they will likely last longer," she wrote."',
			'Thanks for the link. That explanation is interesting. It makes even more interesting on the polarizing effects on us as humans towards climate change. I am definitely looking forward to see the trends in the coming years.',

			'Sadly that\'s the reality now. Would larger evidences change those people? If not, then what may change them? What\'s your opinion? ',
			'As temperature rises, the mean temperature does not increase everywhere equally. The effect is most pronounced at the Arctic where we regularly see anomalies on the order of 3-6C whereas the global average is typically under 1C still. Because of this Arctic Amplification, the temperature gradient along the polar jet stream changes. Since jet stream winds are driven by a strong temperature difference, these winds become weaker and don\'t reliably flow east-to-west (zonally) as well. As this zonal wind flow breaks down, they get more bendy and transport temperature and moisture north-to-south (meridionally). This results in anomalous periods of warmth and increased moisture where winds are transporting from the tropics up to the poles, and it results in periods of cold dry air where winds are transporting from the poles to the tropics. This is why during the cold outbreak along the NE US, temperatures were extremely high in Alaska. The polar jet was flowing north along the Eastern Pacific up into the Arctic, and then it was flowing back down over Canada and into the US. You can see that behavior at this link: https://earth.nullschool.net/#2018/01/14/0000Z/wind/isobaric/250hPa/orthographic=-136.90,44.16,423 Essentially, as the globe warms cold air is less trapped in the Arctic and it is more likely to break out and spread around the upper midlatitudes. We call this the Warm Arctic Cold Continents phenomenon.',
			'Thanks for the explanation! I am aware of the extent of the temperature rise at the Arctic is higher than the global temperature rise. What I am not aware of is this kind of consequences. Besides, Warm Arctic Cold Continents, could you point me out which other consequences that we can expect if exist? These things could be my next reading materials. ',
			'Note: I recommend familiarizing yourself with how 500hPa geopotential height (and anomalies) work as well as some of our common climate teleconnections, like the East Pacific Oscillation (EPO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Arctic Oscillation (AO) before diving into this literature. Here\'s a site that lets you play through forecast models of 500hPa height (and anomalies) and mean sea level pressure, it lets you understand how the Rossby waves that drive our jet stream work:   500 hPa heights and MSLP: https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=nhem&pkg=z500_mslp&runtime=2018011700&fh=-54 500 hPa height anomalies: https://www.tropicaltidbits.com/analysis/models/?model=gfs&region=nhem&pkg=z500a&runtime=2018011700&fh=-54  When these subsequent papers refer to Rossby waves with high wavenumber, they are referring to how many low pressure lobes there are in these 500hPa anomaly graphs.

			'Fahrenheit is great for day to day temperatures--not so much for scientific use though.',
			'I\'d beg to differ. It\'s very useful in your daily life to know ice freezes at 0C. It is pretty easy in that way. Both in the kitchen, where you might use ice, as well as with the weather, since you don\'t exactly expect snow at temperatures above 0C (although it can happen since the air higher up in the sky is colder). Right now it\'s 0C outside, and there\'s this sorry wet snow sludge. 0F is just some temperature. Nothing really important happens at that temperature. I think there was something about brine freezing at that point or something, but who cares about brine? That has no day to day relevance. I guess it\'s nice to know that the average human body is 100F. That offers some degree of relevance, I suppose. Something to compare to. But when you boil water everyday, having 100C set at the boiling temperature of water is also very relevant. All in all, I\'d find Celsius to be far more relatable. And that kind of relatability is kind of useful in day to day temperatures. ',
			'the 32° vs 0° or 100° vs 212° are all arbitrary, and anyone can rationalize how they think any number is easy to memorize, or what they think is convenient. for me, the real reason Fahrenheit is better for day to day temperature is because it is mathematically more descriptive. Basically, like this:  100° F = 38° C 0° F = -18° C  Basically, to describe the same temperature range, Fahrenheit has 101 different numbers, whereas Celsius has 57 different numbers. Therefore, when someone says "it\'s X degrees outside", the Fahrenheit temperature given is a more accurate description of what it really is. Now, of course, you could then say "ok, use decimals with celsius." well if you use them with celsius, you could also use them with fahrenh eight, which makes Fahrenheit even more accurate. but I realize that most people are not math people, and maybe the fact it is a more descriptive scale doesn\'t mean much to them.',

If you replace \'Americans\' with \'American government\', your sentence makes a lot more sense. I have lived in a couple of countries and have friends from many more. What I found was that the general population of any country is more or less similar and wants the same things. And you have good guys and assholes in all countries.

However, it\'s hard to claim that Americans aren\'t their government, when (i) they have the freedom to choose their government; (ii) they choose people that go to war, whether that war is illegal or not; (iii) they don\'t hold the people that commit warcrimes accountable.  We need to start demanding that people be responsible for the governments they elect over and over for decades. You can\'t blame the North Koreans for shit their gov does. Just like China, you can\'t blame the Chinese people for shit the CCP does. Since they literally do not have a choice. When that choice is given, one can\'t just cop out by using a system designed around deniability so that one can say, "It wasn\'t me, it was the government (that we voted for)", or, "It wasn\'t us Dems, it was them evil Republicans". I\'m not saying all Americans are horrible, evil warmongers. I do know a lot of Americans myself, as well as people from all over the world, from different backgrounds and cultures. However, it\'s only ever the Americans and their allies that start being sanctimonious about how freedoms above all else is the only metric that matters and have this amazingly weird ideological fixation, that freedom and democracy are the only things that matter, and should be imposed on another country no matter what.

They just have a model that allows them to draw out long term plans very effectively. Just look at how their cities develop vs. India. Ghost cities get built so that slums don\'t explode. Much of the population has accepted that going with the flow is better than millions dead in an intense series of bloodshed. All for a government that may very well be shittier than the one removed.',

They always keep insisting that a country change its model to one that the west is ideologically fixated on, when that model is currently working to improve the country. Why would China want to adopt the very same models that allow for self-destructive behaviour? Mao was shit, they changed it so Mao doesn\'t happen again. Capitalism was good, so they changed it so that some form of capitalism was adopted. If what they have no is no longer applicable in the future, they\'ll change it too.

			'Just so I don\'t get flamed out here: I think communism is a fundamentally flawed ideology, wildly impractical, and an awfully bad idea. First off this is a tricky question because communism isn\'t really supposed to have a state to begin with, but that\'s impractical to say the least so we will ignore that. That said, I think a communist nation absolutely could have political parties. First we have to recognize that no one has ever implemented anything even vaguely resembling communism. The nations that have generally proclaimed themselves to be communist have been autocracies with a control economy, which is really about as far away from being communist as the US is. Like I said you aren\'t really supposed to have a state, but to the degree that you do have one for practicality it would need to be as pure a democracy as possible. Nationalization and economic control (on which all of those attempts were based) are strictly verboten in communism. So in short: Autocracy and control economies are antithetical to communism, yet every state that has declared itself communist has been based on both. Communism should look like, well, a commune. Everyone works as they see fit, and the fruits of labor are distributed evenly. You should have total freedom of discourse and thought, but property is shared. Can we imagine that situation plus some sort of democracy involving political parties to determine distribution of wealth and social policy? I would say yes, that\'s not too difficult to envision. I could go on for a very long time explaining why that commune would fail on a large scale. I am certain that it is a fundamentally broken ideology, but I just get frustrated by the total inaccurate association between communism and autocracy (and, conversely, the claimed incompatibility of capitalism and autocracy). There are a thousand reasons why communism could never succeed on a large scale, but none of them have anything to do with what we have seen from the states that have claimed to be communist.',

I think people are totally willing to accept products produced by a capitalist company if they were better than what the commune offered; and they\'d probably trade valuables for these better products (just as the actually did in the Society Union and every socialist nation). Socialism can\'t promise the breaks and whistles of capitalist products. This competely competative system leads to a great amount of innovation. Freedom just encourages advancement through competition. Any central authority couldn\'t anticipate technology this quickly.

What all these regimes have in common is authoritarianism - surpression of free speech, limited access to the internet and foreign media, harrassment and arrest of political opponents and journalists, aso. And it does work well for the ruling elites, at least as long as they are strong armed and surpress any opposition.

And to outright claim that "the people are benefiting from it anymore though" when most Chinese people are clearly supportive of their governments and are seeing visible improvements in their lives.. well, I guess you can dismiss it as fear of speaking out or forced support or being brainwashed, but that just makes you guilty of dismissing the voice of people and robbing them of their agency.',
			'I largely agree with you. Free speech is definitely the way to go though, since it allows ideas to clash, thus new ways of seeing things, and potential roads to follow. But this only works when the participants are backed with sound knowledge and sources. Free speech is not suitable for China in its current state. My experience is that they delete the articles written by intellectuals if they feel they have a point. Such as those written by a Burn doctor who criticize the government all the time on the current state of the Chinese medical system. Chinese people know voices are being silenced, information getting blocked, but since the general direction of the country is going well they put up with it.',

No credit at all to the checks put in place to prevent it from happening. Pure luck. I keep seeing people say the system is broken, but for some reason China keeps growing it\'s economy and keeps going into diplomatic and economic talks... so I guess we\'ll just have to wait and see when the system implodes.

Papal Authority, they can force priests to move anywhere they want basically. The priests recompense is to quit the church.   With which fucking police force?

I mean thats fine that you feel that way  If it\'s somehow true, it\'s even more worrying that they can bully people without due process or any relevant autority / law.   When someone is accused the appropriate parish is supposed to convene a private trial, akin to say a disciplinary hearing at a school. That, trial is supposed to determine whether or not the church needs to take action aside from reporting to the authorities like the house arrest solution.  The church used to just defrock priests when they were convicted but then they just went back out into the general population and re-offended so in 2014 they changed to this house arrest method under the guise of mercy when in reality it was just keeping them away from kids.  If they\'re convicted by authorities they go to jail, if they\'re convicted by the church but not the authorities they go to house arrest. At any time the priest can decide to quit but that also opens means he is no longer supported by the church.  Is it meaningless? Perhaps but at least they\'re attempting something to go after these priests when sometimes the standards of a criminal trial prevent conviction. ',

A priest that is defrocked is essentially "fired" by the church which ends their control over the priest.

Pope Benedicts directive was to wash the church\'s hands and cast pedophiles out if they lost their church trial whether or not they were convicted in a criminal court.

The scandal rocked the Catholic Church and greatly hurt its credibility, and many Chileans are still angry over Francis\' decision, in 2015, to appoint a protege of Karadima as bishop of the southern city of Osorno.

Now whether this aid is being used directly or not is irrelevant because 3 billion dollars/year is a lot of money and it creates a lot of leeway for Israel to further entrench its grip on the illegally occupied land and further develop more illegal settlements.

Now their new problem is that the traditional terrorist groups are at odds with all these new feisty upstart mini-terror groups angling to displace the old silver-haired coots who agreed to halt attacks in order to keep the aid money flowing to their foreign bank accounts. The well known players in the Palestinian terror movements don’t even live in Gaza or the West Bank.

Why are we trying to fix other peoples problems when we cant even handle our own problems?',
			'ockquote> Why are we as taxpaying americans expected to just hand out our money to anyone in need overseas?  Foreign aid is an investment by the US. It\'s used to create and sustain influence and soft power with other countries, which is then basically cashed in by the US. It\'s one of the ways countries build and sustain international influence.',
			'ockquote> Why are we as taxpaying americans expected to just hand out our money to anyone in need overseas?  The United States provides funds for Palestinian refugees and the PA so that Israel is relieved of its obligations to pay for the support and care of those people. Why are you so concerned about a few hundred million that the US pays for the benefit of Israel when the money goes to feeding and educating children, but have no problem with billions that the US pays to Israel to fund its military?',
			'Because those billions are often use to buy American hardware and provide Americans jobs.',
			'Good. ',
			'Gee, I wonder who the palestinians will blame rather than their own poor decisions???',
			'Yeah, they should just accept their fate as an occupied and stateless people who are continually harassed and abused. What’s wrong with them?',
			'Well whatever they have tried for decades hasn’t been working ',
			'Things we have tried:  1) unconditional support for Israel no matter what',
			'Wait, what?',
			'US policy, didn\'t you know?',
			'Yeah, I mean their current strategy has worked out great for them, 70 years of success.',
			'There have only been two instances where Israel has made any concessions to the occupied Palestinian population: The Oslo Accords, as a result of the First Intifada; and, the withdrawal of settlements from the Gaza Strip, as a result of the Second Intifada. On the other hand, negotiations have resulted in steadily worsening circumstances. Indeed, it seems Israel is trying to teach the Palestinian populace that the only thing it responds to positively is widespread violent resistance to the occupation, even though that costs a few Israelis, and far more Palestinians, their lives.',
			'Well, they still exist, so there\'s that. ',
			'Constant negotiations since 1991. That has been their strategy. Yes it didn’t work. As long as the USA blocks the UN from enforcing international law nothing will help the Palestinians.',
			'Since 1991...buses exploding everywhere. Stabbings. Shootings. Endless rocket attacks. Suicide bombings. Years of intifada. Calling for the destruction of Israel over anything.',
			'Yes you had years of violence after camp David failed, but you also had years of relative peace before and after that. Nothing has worked to end the Israeli settlement of Palestine. Actually Israel expands faster when there is less violence.',
			'Why can\'t they simply learn from Puerto Rico, accepted their fate and thus no longer remain a \'shit-hole\' country. /s',
			'FACT: 7% of the Abbas govt budget goes to salaries and pensions of terrorists. All agencies funding the “moderate Palestinian govt” are funding terrorism, not development. So, since the Abbas govt has been siphoning development money to terrorism during its entire existence, it is on thin moral ground when it insists the money is put to good use. Little or no good can be expected of this culture, so steeped in terrorism. There is no peaceful purpose in providing any aid to this group whatsoever. Ironically, this is the Palestinian faction that claimed to desire “peace.”',
			'*Hamas gets less money to throw rockets at Israel',
			'For the most part this isn\'t for Hamas. It would go to the PA, controlled by Fatah. So the issues are more Abbas getting rich and paying for terrorist attacks.',
			'This is going to UNRWA, which also operates in Gaza.',
			'Palestine should get 0 aid until they agree to stop paying people to kill jews. ',
			'No sense to give money to terrorists anyways. ',
			'If we stood by that, we wouldn\'t be giving money to many, many more countries, including Israel.',
			'Can I have it?',

			'Palestinian Matyr Fund',
			'Spooky thread',
			'Campaign Promises Fulfilled. ',
			'The Palestinian people deserve so much better than what they have now as leadership.',
			'They voted for it, didn\'t they?',
			'Kind of, but not exactly.  Abbas is in year 13 of his 4 year elected term.  That being said, the PA hasn\'t allowed for new elections pretty much because all of the polls show the Palestinians would elect Hamas, which is far worse from pretty much any perspective. ',
			'So the palestinian people doesnt deserve better leadership, they deserve even worse leadership?',
			'It depends on how strongly you believe in democracy I guess. Honestly, it\'s a really hard question to answer as to what they should do from an elections perspective.',
			'Oh no. Poor Palestine.',
			'How long have the Palestinians been receiving aid, in particular aid for refugees, now? Why hasn\'t, what I assume is, decades of aid and billions of dollars stabilised the region? Maybe it is because the people ruling over them are corrupt and aid is a bandaid which isn\'t going to do shit. ',
			'Not interested in inflammatory discussion on the subject but why doesn\'t anybody ask why the Arab world doesn\'t support their Palestinian brethren.  Donations from the Arab world to the Palestinian Authority have been slashed by 50 percent over the past four years. A mere quarter of the Palestinian Authority\'s 2017 budget of approximately $3.7 billion has come from her Arab neighbors. The bulk was provided primarily by the European Union, the United States and Canada. Those feeling the pinch hardest are the residents of the Gaza Strip. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has cut off almost all government funding to Gaza, which has since 2007 been under the direct control of his Hamas rivals. Please don\'t let facts get in the way of a good story ',
			'Looks like some martyr pensions are about to get cut. Cue the defenders of Palestinian murderers. ',
			'Idc. Maybe the ppl over there should stop murdering each other bc their masters tell them one cult is better than the other. ',
			'[deleted]',
			'Meanwhile Israel gets billions ($36 billion) in military spending money from uncle Sam. It\'s quite apparent what US aims to achieve here.. why do they even bother giving anything to Palestine when their funding to Israel is so disproportionate, it indirectly undermines any chance for peace.',
			'I think they\'re hoping for a single state solution. Thing is, there\'s so many Arabs in Palestine that if that ever did happen, the Jewish Israelis would lose their majority.',
			'Honestly, at this point I\'d be happy with ANY solution as long as the senseless killing and hate ceases. ',
			'I agree. ',
			'The Palestinians have such a shit life-horrible what they\'ve had to endure.',
			'what really surprising saudies are teh second biggest',
			'If my provider isn\'t delivering, then I withhold their payment too.',
			'You guys do realize that this could easily hurt pretty much everyone including the US and Israel? It\'s funding that helps the UNRWA provide things like education, healthcare, sanitation, etc. in not just Palestine but to millions in Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon.  Here\'s an excerpt from a guardian article on the same subject since this source lacks many details.  "While cuts in education may be the most immediate and dramatic, the losses would not stop there. Nine million health consultations which UNRWA doctors provide each year would cease, 1.7 million refugees who lack basic needs would be without food and cash assistance and 40,000 refugees with disabilities would be without support. Further, UNRWA recreational activities for 200,000 children would cease and the 38,000 microfinance clients working to provide an independent livelihood for their families would be without loans. On top of this, 30,000 teaching staff, doctors, nurses, social workers, sanitation labourers and engineers employed by UNRWA would be out of a job. Has the US, and Israel for that matter, thought this through? Do they really want 270,000 children in Gaza attending Hamas-run schools? Does Washington really know what it is doing?" https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/12/donald-trump-cut-funding-palestinian-refugees-middle-east-security',
			'It is in Israel\'s and USA\'s interests to severely cut the aid money, but not to remove it completely. They know all too well that a portion of it goes towards humanitarian efforts, so the plan to remove the aid completely was scrapped and settled for half. The PA could very easily compensate for the loss by drawing from its terror budget, and so could Hamas.',
			'No. It\'s in the US\'s interest to fuck off and quit fooling with either one of them. I\'m sick of paying for those fuckers. ',
			'ockquote> Does Washington really know what it is doing?  If this isn\'t yet apparent, no, no they do not.',
			'All the palestinians have to do in order to mitigate that shortfall is to stop paying stipends to the terrorists, constituting, unless I am mistaken, about 7% of the entire budget of the palestinian autonomy.',
			'Yeah, No. Those are the funds paid to the families of all Palestinians killed, injured or jailed by Israel. It is, for all intents and purposes, the same as disability insurance, the stipends the US or Israel pay to the families of service members killed in action, or a basic social safety-net, designed to ensure that poor people can eat and survive even after Israel does whatever it does to their family members. It is likely that a very, very small amount of that money goes to the families of people who did actually commit terrorist acts, but the law is designed to held all Palestinians burdened by the actions of Israel, not "terrorists" as people like you tend to falsely claim. Sure, there are some Israelis that believe all Palestinians are terrorists -- the Israeli Justice Minister, for example -- but no sane person accepts that, or the generalized claims by Israel that attacks on members of the IDF in the OPT constitute terrorism.',
			'Considering Syria, Lebanon and Palestine all want Israel to be destroyed, and Jordan isn\'t much better.',
			'How is that our responsibility? It is America’s privilege to help the world and we do so much, and I’m ok with that. But aren’t we just enabling a system that makes no sense? Shouldn’t we, as responsible leaders, have some type of conditions that the Palestinians AND Israelites develop their own plan to not be dependent on another nation for their own damn existence? This sounds harsh, but fuck, we have our own problems, and we’re borrowing from the Chinese to give them money? ',
			'Good, now that money can be used for our national debt.',
			'I\'m going to be the black sheep here, but I must ask... why are we not spending the money towards United States homeless veterans or children in the foster system, or our senior citizens... first? I\'m all about helping people, don\'t get me wrong, but it breaks my heart to see and hear all these tax payers barely making ends meet, or innocent children brought into the world by assholes and idiots get neglected, and people fighting for our country not getting aid or enough aid. I\'m open for an answer, I\'m not 100% close minded, I would just like to know why that is the case. Why are people all pissed that Trump isn\'t issueing $65,000,000 to a foreign country when we have a lot of problems at home?',
			'because if you wouldn\'t send that money abroad it wouldn\'t be used to help the poor and the old and the homeless. it just wouldn\'t. those people wont get more if you give others less because frankly, america doesn\'t care about it\'s own people in need. it doesn\'t care about foreign people in need either.... it only cares about how the rest of the world perceives it',
			'Now how about we do the same with Israel, until this whole Palestinian issue is worked out, with some kind of respect and love for them as a people.'

			'This probably has nothing to do with the billions that they are legally, but unethically, avoiding to pay with their low tax offshore system. They probably just made some mistakes on their accounts and auditors corrected the mistakes.',
			'Eh, if an EU nation (and a highly developed one, at that) wants to charge lower taxes than the rest of the organization and no one is willing to call their shit, I\'d probably file my taxes there too. ',
			'This is NOT Apple filing their taxes in Ireland and paying 12.5% tax. Apple has been paying an average of ~1% tax for years, sometimes as low as 0.05% tax. This £136m is peanuts compared to what they would owe if they used a reasonable interpretation of the law.',
			'I agree it\'s a hideous insult to think this would "hurt" poor Apple.',
			'You\'re not wrong. Tax avoidance is an international issue. You cant blame the companies, they\'re doing their duty to the shareholders. We need greater international cooperation in this area',
			'I can and do blame these companies. Fuck them for every school and hospital that doesn\'t get built, every operation that gets cancelled, every child that goes hungry because of government cutbacks all because these fuckers have siphoned off trillions of dollars of tax revenue across the globe.  If you get away with murder because you\'ve got a great lawyer who\'s able to exploit a loophole in the system, then we need to try and fix the system, but that doesn\'t mean you\'re not an evil son of a bitch who deserves to go to hell, if such a place existed. And you\'re kidding yourself if you don\'t think people die as a result of tax avoidance.',
			'There are thousands of ways you could arrange the legal entity structure of a multinational corporation’s holdings and thousands more ways and venues to file taxes in. Some of these options are perfectly legal, yet cheaper than other options. One, what sane person wouldn’t pick the cheapest legal option?  Two, if you have to opt out of the cheapest option in favor of social responsibility as you imply, then how much extra do you decide to pay? There’s a nearly endless continuum of less efficient ways to pay taxes, and quite understandably no mechanism to dictate selections like that. Third, it absolutely is a CEO’s duty to conduct the business in the way shareholders want, which almost always entails things like: maximize profit (or in the case of your suggestion here: don’t waste money pointlessly when obvious cheaper alternatives are available)',
			'ockquote> Some of these options are perfectly legal, yet cheaper than other options.  And when there\'s no cheaper legal option, you can always buy a few legislators to invent them for you. The question isn\'t about what these companies should do any more, they\'re crossed that boundary long ago. The question is how we bring them back under control. They\'ve bought the regulators to the point where they don\'t even bother trying to hide it any more. We, the people, need to find other ways to make them change, and make them pay reparations. When you\'re outside, look at the crumbling infrastructure and understand they\'re doing this.  If you see a pothole in the road, remind yourself and remind others "This is Apple\'s pothole".  If you see a beggar, remind yourself and remind others "This is Apple\'s beggar".  When you see emergency infrastructure fail when it\'s most needed, remind yourself and remind others "This is Apple\'s disaster". Those taxes they\'ve avoided paying would have maintained infrastructure, employed people, provided social services. Instead, it\'s a massive cash pool benefiting nobody but a few very wealthy individuals. It\'s corruption made legal by buying laws.',
			'Lots of companies don\'t set up byzantine structures to avoid taxes aggressively. It\'s a decision and not a mandatory requirement.',

			'OK sure. According to this guy they don\'t have a duty. But ask any CEO or board of directors. Their goal is to deliver the highest possible value to shareholders. That means minimising profits. I am NOT saying thats the way it should be, or that its right, but that is the way it is.',
			'And what they are doing is evil and they try to hide behind this bullshit of "duty to shareholders", which is a load of crap. I agree, the law needs to change, but to pretend that these companies and the people who run them have no fault in this is just farcical.',

			'Apple reported 26.4%. That\'s different than actually paying 26.4%. The way it works is simple. Apple shifts profits around, ending up in Ireland. There, they have an agreement that money that they will send to the US, isn\'t taxed by Ireland. Meanwhile; the US has a rule that the money is only taxed when it\'ll arrive in the US. Apple thus avoids taxes by saying that they\'ll send the money to the US (thus not paying taxes in Ireland), and then not actually sending it (thus not paying taxes in the US). Now, Apple\'s reasoning is that they\'ll send it eventually, at some point in the future. Thus, according to them, these profits don\'t count in the tax calculation (hence the 26.4% figure). They might do it, especially if Trump cuts their tax rate. The EU disagrees, saying that the tax rate is the tax they actually pay, not the tax they\'ll eventually pay if they decide to bother with doing so.',
			'Your heart’s in the right place but your accounting is terrible. Forune had a good article breaking down what Apple reported and what was paid in cash to the US and elsewhere.',
			'ockquote> Apple reported 26.4%. That\'s different than actually paying 26.4%.  No, it isn\'t. They report their taxes in SEC filings and similar, in which context it is illegal to lie and doing so would result in executives being arrested. The 26.4% is the percentage of their profits worldwide gone to taxes.',
			'Tax avoidance is not a lie. Shifting profits, and delaying repatriation of international profit are all perfectly legal in the US.',
			'ockquote> Tax avoidance is not a lie  No, but the financial reports must, under penalty of imprisonment, have accurate information. Whether taxes are avoided or not, the amount paid must be in those filings.',

			'ockquote> If you want to argue if they pay taxes world wide, then yes, they do an you\'re right.

			'An iphone is not a share.',
			'This would not likely be material to their stock price. This is a super simplified analysis but Apple\'s EPS for 2017 was $9.21. $184 million (in USD) would be approximately $0.04 per share or 0.4% of their earnings. So even if this was expected to be a recurring charge it would be expected to have less than a 1% impact on their stock price. Since it\'s (as far as I know) a one-time charge it would have even less of an effect. That would generally be considered indistinguishable from typical daily stock market noise. Additionally, errors happen, you would have to show that there was some actual wrongdoing or substantial negligence. ',
			'That\'s a lot of back taxes. ',
			'Still only a drop in the pond unfortunately',
			'Apple made $216 billion in revenue. These back taxes are not even 0.001%',
			'Since when do you pay tax on the revenue? You pay tax on your profits. You can have a revenue of 1 billion USD but if you don\'t make a profit you won\'t have to pay taxes. This percentage is meaningless.',
			'It actually is well more than 0.001% It\'s more like .09%'
