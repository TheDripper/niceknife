			'This is no surprise to me. Facebook is 98% useless garbage noise and maybe 2% actually socializing with friends now It’s become junk mail',
			'It has all the social appeal of credit card offers you get in the mail.',
			'ockquote> IS THIS REAL LOVE?! I WANT YOUR DICK NOW IN MY PUSSI CALL NOW  I\'m not even straight, where do i get these spam mails from even..',
			'I would say the bots find accounts that fit their “demographic”, for instance male and over the legal age, and then proceeds to spam. How they obtain the account’s age and gender info to spam, either they scour the site for it, or FB directly sells the owner of the bots the info. ',
			'Dude, I\'m a female and most of the spam I get is about helping me fix my erectile dysfunction...',
			'Dont forget how they now want to see a high resolution picture of your face when you create a new profile. That\'s ridiculous. Deleted my facebook because of this. ',
			'As with several other websites I could name, to use facebook you have to reject the algorithm. You can ignore and unfollow people, but IMO it\'s far better to create a friends list with all of the people whose posts you want to see. Going to that friends list shows you what those people have posted and shared IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER. No "[friend] liked this" or "[family member] commented on that". No algorithm trying to show you what it thinks you want to see. Just the posts of the people you care about in the order that those posts were made. Once you make this list, make a bookmark so you can go directly to it. Then when you visit facebook, you go to your list, scroll down until you see something you recognize, and you\'re done! Even if you comment a few times, it won\'t take very long. No more endless scrolling.',
			'I might have to try that. The day Facebook took over my ability to see posts in chronological order was the beginning of the end for me. I pretty much only use is now at all for a few close friends and family which FB makes it hard for me to see or enjoy. ',
			'My favourite is when I see posts from the sports teams I follow... Telling me halftime scores for a game that finished yesterday.',
			'Wow, exactly. I never would\'ve made that comparison, but it is so obvious. It is junk mail. ',
			'Everybody\'s families added them and it stopped being fun',
			'The South Park episode captured this perfectly.',
			'ockquote> I sent you a funny picture and you didn\'t even respond to it.  This is word by word something my dad says to me on a semi-regular basis.',
			'One of my former girlfriend\'s cousins once called her in tears, asking why she hated that cousin\'s kids so much that she never liked any of the baby pictures she posted. It\'s fucking insane. ',
			'I feel like a lot of these people showed up late and don’t really “get” how the internet works. There’s supposed to be a base assumption that everyone is kind of lightly preoccupied at all times. If you send someone a message and they don’t get back to you, tou let it slide because they probably had it five tabs deep and didn’t notice. A lot of these newcomers don’t get that, and seem to think that not clicking like on a photo actually translates to actively disliking the subject of the photo. It turns a literal non-occurrence into an active snub in a real dumb way',
			'My dad thinks everyone\'s posts are directed at him.',
			'This one is. ',
			'All of mine are.',
			'My mother is the same .... "I know he posted this thing at that time because he saw I was online !!!" Uh, okay.',
			'That online thing about facebook is just damaging to the mind of everyone. That and the "seen <timestamp>" Fucking horrible.',
			'You’re so vain...you probably think this post is about you. ',
			'ockquote> five tabs deep  What is this? Amateur hour? ',
			'It\'s because old people don\'t know the rest of the internet exists. Their entire online world is Facebook and they assume that\'s true of everyone.',
			'Absolutely. In the past few months my mom, dad, my 78 year old aunt, and several other family members added me and so I felt obligated to add them back. This has effectively killed using Facebook for me because I can\'t have a conversation with one of my friends, or post some shitty/witty status update that only my closest buddies would get, without my elderly aunt adding a "like" and weighing in like she knows what the fuck we\'re talking about. If I even briefly mention trying out that new bottle of whiskey to my brother, my mom joins the conversation and posts some tl;dr comment about the dangers of alcohol abuse. WTF. ',
			'You can select who sees your posts and create different filters I\'m pretty sure',
			'When my dad first got on fb and friended me, he used to like literally everything I posted.  Younger me was kinda embarrassed about it for some reason, so I commented with good intentions (but in reality prob sounded snarky), "Dad you don\'t have to click like on everything I post." (On one of my pictures he liked) This was years ago and he hasn\'t liked anything I\'ve posted since. I don\'t care about the likes, but I feel bad, like I prob hurt his feelings. It was just a lot at the time I felt like he was blowin up my spot.  We live far away, he was prob enjoying watching what his son was getting up to and wanted to feel like he was interacting. I wish I could take back what I said.  Never forget that its never "not cool" to have people that love you, is what I\'ve taken away from all this.  Also, Facebook has the tendency to make shit weird. Always. ',
			'Just a suggestion from a stranger on the internet who has to apologize to parents for hurting their feelings like that from time to time -- if you\'re still thinking about it and feel bad, I\'m sure he\'d appreciate it if you gave a call and cleared it up. It\'s those super little things that seem like they\'re way too late or too small-scale to bother with that actually make a huge difference. Not that I\'m anywhere near a shining example of stuff like that because I definitely still hurt my parents\' feelings as an adult, but little apologies when I recognize what\'s happened go a really long way. Either way, hope you and your dad are cool these days.',
			'Dude you could always just tell him that... not so complicated. ',
			'Use the phone, and say, "Dad--this is crazy, but this one incident has been bothering me-------." He will appreciate it.',
			'Stan, poke your grandma!',
			'It was so cool in 2007. I reconnected with so many old friends, played games, and got caught up in the great pirate/ninja war. Then my family started joining. Then visual quotes exploded. Then the algorithm turned it into a massive echo chamber for bullshit. Now I just use it to message people once in a while.',
			'ockquote> Then the algorithm turned it into a massive echo chamber for bullshit.  THIS! i have fucking 1000 friends and all i see are the same fucking 5 turd-bags who post drama about their personal lives. ',
			'I wish it would just stop trying to guess what/who I want to see. I just want a simple feed: show me everything from my friends as it gets posted. That’s it. ',
			'Back in the days it did. I don\'t know what the fuck happened. ',
			'Well now facebook "decides" what you want to see. Fucking stupid. If I add someone it means I want to see them in the feed. Seemed simple enough. ',
			'Facebook helped me decide I didn\'t want to use it anymore',
			'And it seems to be stuck on not just a few people, but a few specific posts of theirs. “Refreshing” loads the same goddamn feed, plus like 2 “new” (two days ago) items.  When I refresh, I want you to find other things that my 800 friends have posted, and give me a whole goddamn new feed to scroll through - which means more ads! This doesn’t seem like that difficult of a concept, FB peeps.',
			'Exactly! I don\'t mind scrolling past the ads... I just want to see the lastest posts from the people i have added... Not just ten of them over and over and over. ',
			'The thing is, it\'s really dumb because you can follow a news page, and then won\'t see breaking news until 2 days after it was posted',
			'SERIOUSLY!! also, just because I don’t constantly like/comment on someone’s post doesn’t mean I don’t want to see them. AND just because I like a someones post doesn’t mean I want to see all her post all the time.',
			'Yeah I was actually surprised to see some people I care about had posted a lot of new and interesting stuff, since I hadn\'t seen a shred of activity from their profiles I live across the world from my brothers, so it\'s the best way to keep up with them. Last time I went to visit them, they were all talking about some fun videos my brother had made and put online. I checked, there was almost a video a day for three months, and my whole family and friends liking them and commenting on them I hadn\'t seen a single one, because Facebook had decided I wasn\'t interested in my brother',
			'Facebook thinks I hate my best friends and never shows me their stuff, because I never interact with them on the site. Like, if this person has been a dear friend to me for years now I\'m not gonna wish them happy birthday with a sterile message among dozens of others, I\'m gonna give them a call. On the other hand, I am going to wish happy birthday to people i don\'t particularly care about but I need to keep good relationships with. So the algorithm gets the wrong hint and only shows me updates from people I don\'t like too much. ',
			'This is like youtube now. Watch one video and next thing you know every recommended vodeo is about whatever you watched...',
			'Yeah totally. It’s like isn’t there 1.3 billion videos on YouTube? Why tf am I recommended the same stuff all the time. I’m just annoyed that these companies think they know what you want. Sorry guys, you don’t. ',
			'Or like when you look up a lot of a type of video for a short period of time for a specific reason, all your recommendeds are of that one thing, instead of the stuff you\'ve been consistently watching for years I wish the algorithm weighted topics that you\'ve watched consistently over time more than the one day you looked up thirty jazz trap remixes',
			'I mean YouTube probably wouldn\'t be what it is today if a lot of people didn\'t end up lost clicking video after video until they realize they\'re halfway through a cooking video but all they have in the fridge is ramen and some left over pizza. But it doesn\'t matter because all you have is a hot plate you aren\'t supposed to and a microwave.',
			'Yes, but it was more enjoyable when the suggested videos were based more on what you were currently watching, rather than your watch history',
			'I bought a book I didn\'t really like without looking so much into it on Amazon. Since that book was horse shit, Amazon assumes I like horse shit, and all the other people who bought books by that shitty author are a bunch of dumb fucks who like horse shit books, so Amazon is recommending me all the horse shit crap that they like. One fucking book by mistake and it\'s over. ',
			'They keep giving me ads for things I\'ve bought from them. Which is fine for food or socks, but i don\'t need a crock pot. I already have a brand new one and Amazon explicitly knows this. ',
			'No kidding, this is one of the dumbest oversights common in recommendation algorithms. You buy a new dishwasher, and now you just get unceasing recommendations and ads for dishwashers. I have a brand new one thanks, I\'m good on dishwashers for the next decade. If anything, they should be blacklisting dishwashers from ever appearing for the next several years. They can still derive useful info from this. I\'d expect info about how high-end the model is, what brand it is, what color it is, demographics of who typically buys that kind of dishwasher, etc to all make it into recommendations. But certain categories of purchases are kinda "one and done" sort of affairs.',
			'I\'m in my 40s and don\'t see drama but I do see people in their 50s and 60s who sit at home all day, accept every request from their own friends and family as well as all friend requests from the Philippines, Ghana, and Kenya (so they now have 1500 friends), and they post a picture of their half eaten toast in the morning and get 284 likes.',
			'Must be like when i made a instagram so my family wouldn’t follow me and i could be myself on social media for once. One month later somehow my mother and aunts found me. I was so fucking annoyed and still am now thinking about it.',
			'a bunch of people im following on ig have a public and a private insta, if im correct i think you can prevent your profile from being displayed in follow recommendations. that option might work for you',
			'Facebook owns Instagram now. Heard they’re doing the spooky recommendations from unconnected accounts thing again on IG too.',
			'I deleted my instagram and old facebook about a year and a half ago and recreated a new instagram about a week ago. I did everything I could to stop getting recommendations from old fb friends. I deleted both fb & messenger (new profile and different email), i tried to clear everything and block any trace of facebook. My current facebook is to a different email, since the old deactivated one is connected to my current email. OKAY anyways new instagram, everything cleared everything blocked or deleted, and when I sign in.. I still get recommended as "sign in as ***". It drives me nuts. Then I get people recommended to me whom I should follow. From my deactivated facebook to make it better. I can\'t search someone up without an old facebook friend popping up. Ugh, insane! :( ',
			'Yup. Even before I had connected my Facebook account (which is now deactivated) to Instagram, I was getting recommendations to follow people that I was friends with on Facebook. It continues to do that, even though my FB is gone now, and even asks me from time to time to re-activate/reconnect it again. ',
			'Facebook was great when it was just for university students and it was closed network, but as xkcd put it: when you try to be the walmart of social interaction, you become the walmart of social interaction.',
			'Explained concisely by this tweet from Startup L Jackson:  The economics of building a social network: focus only on growth until the old people move in, then monetize aggressively as it slowly dies. ',
			'Zuckerberg knows this, which is precisely why he scoops up any new and upcoming social network',
			'Instagram. So hot right now. But fuck they kill their other social networks too. Instagram was great before Facebook came in. Now it is completely monetized up and down which I understand. You need it to make you money. But it is getting shitty like Facebook. Too many ads, you don\'t get an option to see chronologically, I get far too many 5 day old posts. It\'s a mess frankly.  The only Facebook owned app I still use is WhatsApp and only because a large percentage of people overseas use it. I wish Apple would open FaceTime/iMessage to Android so I could kill WhatsApp off my phone. Apple is more interested in user experience and privacy and I imagine FB uses WhatsApp location data and heuristics try and feed me dumb ads on the networks I don\'t use. SnapChat recently fucked their user base with their redesign. It brings more commercial content into your feed and makes it harder to ignore.',
			'Agree with you on all counts. I think people use Instagram in a fundamentally different way than Facebook. My wife uses it almost exclusively to find new brands and spot fashion trends. Another friend uses it to look at funny videos and memes (like a proto Reddit). There is very little actual sharing. ',
			'And nobody goes to Walmart intentionally. You don\'t do to Walmart for fun. You go there either because you have a very specific thing you need or you don\'t have a choice. EDIT: RIP inbox. 😶',
			'Well when you live in a small poor redneck town with nothing to do we like to smoke some weed and go fuck around in Walmart so I guess our Walmart is fun to us... Go ahead and make of me :(',
			'Won’t make fun of you. Walmart destroys small towns. Sonora, CA used to be the coolest little town we could go to in just a few hours drive. It’s near Yosemite, tons of outdoor activities, and was full of mom and pop shops. Walmart came in and everyone was so excited. Then all the small shops were driven out of business. It’s a meth haven now you only go there to get gas and if you don’t keep an eye on your car it’ll get broken in to.',
			'Been to Sonora many times... sad that it was actually a destination at one point.',
			'This is so pure to me for some reason lol ',
			'Upvote for being honest',
			'Yeah, you go to Target for fun',
			'So what\'s the Target of the internet?',
			'Reddit 😎',
			'I mean, I\'ve wound up at both places late at night not really knowing why I\'m there.',
			'Not trying to be "that guy", but in Utah, some Walmarts are 24 hours, while everything else closes at 9, so we\'d go there to sort of hang-out, because it was the only place to go after 9. edit: fuck, you\'re right; we went there because it was the only place open/we didn\'t have a choice.',
			'ockquote> so we\'d go there to sort of hang-out, because it was the only place to go after 9.   This is what makes people try drugs',
			'Former heroin addict here, used to hang out at Wal mart for all sorts of reasons 1) can hang out 2) could steal food if I was hungry 3) could meet my drug dealer there 4) could buy syringes there 5) could shoot up there 6) could go back out and sit At subway and do nothing 7) go to electronics and get on the internet bc you know I didn’t have any electronic device of my own.  Basically for trashy people wal mart provides an endless source of productivity, wonder and amazement. ',
			'til i am a trashy person Edit: Reddit friends, I appreciate the sentiment, but I am not addicted to heroin lol. I just go on extended walks in Walmart from time to time, which is why I posted this',
			'Sorta like Facebook. Huh.',
			'Can confirm. Walmart made me try drugs. ',
			'Specifically diabetes medication.',
			'You played yourself. ',
			'He pulled a Walton.',
			'He became a billionaire while using government subsidies to pay employees? ',
			'Remember Farmville?',
			'I had aunts who I thought were really interesting and smart who I had friended on Facebook. And then got endless Farmville and Candycrush notices from them, like they did nothing but dink around with silly games all day. I\'d rather not know.',
			'Fun fact: you can delete your page and keep the messenger app. I\'m like 2 months facebook free and it feels good man. Feels good.',
			'Too bad Messenger is also hot garbage. "Post something about your day!" "X just joined Messenger, be the first to message them!" "X is active now!" "You have a two day streak with X, message them again to continue your streak!" They can fuck right off with that Snapchat bullshit, I just need a way to message people now and then.',
			'This is what I should do. I never actually use the Facebook part and only use Messenger now days.',
			'I\'m so old I remember what you had to have an .edu email address to join. People were afraid once high schoolers could join it would go downhill quick. They weren\'t wrong. ',
			'I think it was the demographic shift up, not down, that made it what it is today.',
			'Yup. I knew Facebook was dead when I got a friend request from my mom. ',
			'Moms use the shit out of Facebook.',
			'Hell yeah they do. They share the fuck out of minion memes. ',
			'I was applying for a job at a startup and looked at their Facebook page. It was minion videos every other post with the staff sharing generic positive “reviews” on how great it is to work there. I did not apply',
			'Was it Illumination Entertainment?',
			'My mom in 1998: "The internet is big and scary and you can\'t trust anyone!" My mom in 2018: "Did you know Hillary Clinton is still running cocaine through her private Arkansas airbase? I read all about it on HillaryForPrison.ru!"',
			'Fuck dude.. you\'re not lyin\' here The people who always chastised anyone for mentioning they read something on the internet are the worst ones reading all of Facebook\'s fake news shit articles that are catering to their echo chamber.  I hadn\'t even realized this yet. ',
			'Do you know how many old people I\'ve had to tell that Mr.Rogers wasn\'t a US Navy SEAL in Vietnam?',
			'Wow, that rumor has escalated. A few years ago the story was he was a marksman, glad he made it up to SEALs.',
			'They made that share button big enough for them to smash every time a half inspired quote about grandchildren is slapped on a dodgy background of trees.',
			'My mom was completely inept with computers. senior, 75+. Then she got her first grandkid. Now she\'s like a friggin tween on the app. ',
			'My mom’s also a senior citizen, on Facebook all the time. Her huge background photo for her profile is my husband and kid. She pays over $100 annually for Dell customer support and she contacts them multiple times per month to virtually take over her computer so they can move around her new pictures from her camera and label them in folders how she wants so she can more easily upload to Facebook. It’s fucking crazy. She’s computer illiterate outside of Facebook.',
			'Sounds like she\'s getting great value from Dell.',
			'Stan, poke your Grandma!',
			'Facebook isn\'t dead, contacting mom (and all my extended family) is just its sole purpose now. ',
			'I use it almost exclusively for group chat.',
			'I had a .edu email from a small school and FB said it wasn’t an authorized university or something. I remember being legitimately pissed off.',
			'Yeah I remember asking friends if they had it yet and they told me they were sticking with MySpace.',
			'It wasn’t the high schoolers that made it go downhill. It was their parents. The high schoolers used it to connect and play games. ',
			'Same reason I got off of there. If they had an option to turn off the "news" I\'d consider coming back. The environment is very toxic. I\'d gladly go back to silly pet videos and food photos instead of what people think of Donald Trump or Obama every day of the week.',
			'Oh my god, this... turn off the fucking news, and get rid of shared posts... burn them. Do they really want these people cheapening the hell out of their site? Shared posts actually drove me off Facebook years ago, as it just gave bored people I don\'t even want to hear from a license to bother other people. I only visit every 1-2 months now.',
			'I seriously contemplated deleting the app once they started this annoying \'cheering\' shit... If you don\'t post for a while and then you suddenly post something, you\'re welcomed the next day saying something like "you posted something yesterday!! Keep up the great work!!" No shit fuck stick!! I don\'t need you to patronize me!!',
			'I got on facebook when I met my wife 10ish years ago and hooked back up with a lot of old friends. When my mother joined she started commenting on every post I made. I stopped posting. I haven\'t logged on in a month and I get three emails a day from them asking if I have seen the post from whoever.  I have not. Real life is better. ',
			'just saying, facebook does suck but you can block your mom from seeing your posts. i block my grandma because she makes dumb off topic comments on everything i do ',
			'You can block your mum from seeing your posts but if you like a post that’s public she can see that. My friend messaged me to ask why the hell my mum had liked one of his status updates (which I had also liked). He’s never even met her.  I also can’t RSVP to any public events without my mum liking / commenting on it.  I’ve looked into changing my privacy settings for this but it’s all down to the settings by the poster or event creator, so it’s out of your hands. ',
			'ockquote> I’ve looked into changing my privacy settings for this  Thing is, you can do this sort of thing to some extent but it goes against Zuckerberg\'s philosophy of why the service exists in the first place, which is why you can never QUITE do it. I would love it, for example, if more of its settings could be set to "friends only" instead of "friends of friends" but again, that\'s just not why it exists.',
			'I think if they kept it simple, but fb kept building and building, until there was 75% clickbait , 10% trash and maybe something I’d care to see, there’s a model buried in thee that might work, but I expect if anyone bought stock, sell it. Soon.',
			'Yep. I don\'t even see my friends posts anymore. Are they just not posting like me, or are they making us sift through videos with text on them before we get to see their posts? Either way I removed the app off my phone. Useless even for toilet browsing.',
			'I live in Slovakia, one of the few countries where Facebook is testing the \'Explore Feed\'. https://mashable.com/2017/10/23/facebook-explore-publisher-post-organic-reach-drop/ Basically, all posts by pages are moved from the News Feed to a separate Explore Feed and the News Feed is friends content only. And although I don\'t really use Facebook that much even I have noticed it makes for a much much better experience. Let\'s hope they make it global soon!  Edit: And from what I hear most people don\'t use the Explore Feed at all. Who would have guessed that? /s Edit 2: This is how it looks https://i.imgur.com/LleOhVS.png ',
			'I have been saying I want seperate feeds for friends and pages for so fucking long.  I don\'t need to test it to know that it will be better.',
			'It clearly would be better cause when you are bored you can explore pages feed and waste time and your usual stuff will be just seeing what your friends are doing. That being said, Nobody posts anything interesting or worth taking a look over anyways nowadays. Its either fun party photos or just activity cards.',
			'Sure, but that\'s a bit of a chicken/egg scenario. I\'d probably start using facebook again if I knew my friends were actually going to see anything I post.',
			'ockquote> sift through videos with text on them   I thought that was just my wife\'s feed, that\'s what it\'s like for everyone, huh? ',
			'I noticed this yesterday as well. 13 of the 15 posts i scrolled over were videos. Sometimes it’s not even videos people share, some were just “X commented on a video”. They are really pushing videos, probably to get more revenue from the ads that play halfway through them.',
			'ockquote> 75% clickbait, 10% trash and maybe something I\'d care to see  Adds up to 99% trash in my book.',
			'My facebook feed has gotten absolutely awful in the past 6 months. Almost all "content" is from horrible memes, videos and images created by everyone except my friends. I don\'t want to see any gif recipes or memes that people think are funny. The only thing I want to see if original content of people who are my friends and family.  I mean, it\'s soooooo bad. ',
			'Same. If I see one more ‘Actual video of me on a Monday morning’ animal gif that someone I haven’t seen in years liked near the top of my feed I’m going to punch something. I have to sift through so much meme junk to see an originally written status by someone. Soooo bad :(',
			'FB is kind of a bummer because over the nearly 10 years or so that I\'ve used it I\'ve added a lot of people that were real cool/neat/what have you. We don\'t keep up any sort of real friendship but it\'s neat to see how they\'re doing now and again. I keep it because I know I\'ll never talk to any of those people again if I close it.',
			'That\'s exactly the only reason why I kept it, especially after college where all your friends disperse. Whenever I travel, I look to see if the people I know still live there and hit them up. Beyond that I don\'t go on it daily (like maybe once every three months or so). It\'s funny because I didn\'t even notice the transition of me not using it. I just got tired of posting and thinking of what others thought about it. Definitely became a lot happier as that was the only social media platform I used. I was focusing on my happiness rather than trying to impress others (barely do any social media). ',
			'I hate it. Too much family on it. Too many employers trying to stalk me on it trying to pry into my social life. Mostly the second part though. Who cares if I have a picture of me drinking with friends? I come in on time and do my work, what else matters?',
			'I applied for a job and got hired a while back. My boss said she tried to find me on facebook to look through my profile and seemed perplexed when I told her I didn\'t have one. That\'s one of the reasons I don\'t have one!',
			'my boss stated at the time he was hiring for a few positions, that if the candidate didn\'t have a FB profile, he\'d be suspicious and go so far to ask "why" during the interview. i questioned him, with a "would you really do that?" and he said yeah. he was seriously down on people who didn\'t have one. weird i thought',
			'ockquote> Too many employers trying to stalk me  Lock down your profile, problem solved. You can see my profile picture, the cover photo....and NOTHING else. All my pictures, videos, etc are all set to "friends" or even more locked down.',
			'Oh yeah, I know. My privacy settings are set to friends only. I bring this up because a year or two ago, in the startup I was working for, my boss tried adding me fb after the interview because my profile was mostly locked down to friends. Wasn’t having any of that. ',
			'How did he respond when you denied his request? Was he mad?',
			'Some companies will not even hire people if they don\'t have a Facebook page they can stalk. My entire Facebook is just a single picture. And nothing else. People think it\'s weird that I don\'t want to share my life on the internet. ',
			'ockquote> employers trying to stalk me on it trying to pry into my social life.  Employers having access creeps me the fuck out.',
			'I haven’t posted directly to Facebook in over a year. I post to my Twitter occasionally which will then post to my Facebook. Then only reason I haven’t deleted it yet is because I’m afraid I’d lose contact with a lot of people that wouldn’t have a way to other wise. ',
			'Just unfollow everyone on your friends list. I did this and only kept posts from a local animal shelter. So in the off chance someone does mention an invite to something OR I end up on facebook from a link or whatever, all I see are awesome posts of local dogs, then I leave.',
			'Maybe we\'re not supposed to remain in contact with everyone we used to know. If they really want to get ahold of you. They will find a way.',
			'Had this epiphany and deleted my Facebook at the very start of this year. I feel different and less worried about what other people are up to. I think far less about people from my past.  I recommend it to anyone that has negativity in their life involving facebook or addiction to social media. ',
			'That\'s my thought. I mean it\'s nice to see what distant family/friends are doing, but it truly has nothing to do with my real life; I have no connection to them whatsoever. ',
			'Social media has changed quite a lot over the last few years though. Over the last few years, I see less and less of what people are doing, and more and more of easily digestible image macro and shareable stories. Not to mention, every single brand has a Facebook. So you have a mix of your friends, your family (because EVERYONE has one), brands that you follow, and advertisements. But it is a lot more than that: there\'s also any posts that your friends, family, or brands that you follow comment on, like, share, etc. The algorithm decided that you have too many people and posts to see, so it sorts them by what it thinks you find important. So certain friends and brands slip away behind the algorithm, which in turn causes you to see and Like their stuff less, and eventually are gone, because you never Like their content. Which continues to cycle over and over until they are invisible. So that friend, that you follow, will disappear from your feed and unless you actively search them out, you won\'t ever see what they are up to. Then people realize they are bored with seeing the dame things over and over from the same small group of people, some not realizing their other friends are still posting, they\'re just stuck behind an algorithmic filter. So they leave. Causing this same thing to cycle and cycle and cause less people to be interested, and in turn, less interesting to the filters. I don\'t know, I\'ve had a lot of jumbled thoughts on this.

We might not always be great with people who express fairly extreme (usually more conservative) opinions, but I find the conversations here are 100x more stimulating.

They are playing it safe, until investigation is ready and prosecutors can completely analyze whether it is likely they can make a terrorism charge stick in court under Italian legal framework.',

			'White people have been openly called terrorists throughout history. In the 90\'s we would happily call the IRA terrorists, because they were. The IRA used indiscriminate violence to spread political messages and ideas. In this case you just have a racially motivated attack, that\'s not indiscriminate violence to spread a message or idea that\'s very discriminate violence with the sole purpose of killing the target. If he had went out into the streets shooting people at random while promoting white supremacy then that would be called a terrorist attack. Racists committing racially motivated violence is literally just that, it\'s not "terrorism".',
			'Well I would call racial motivation suitable ideological cause to furthering for this was done. Thus making it ideologically motivated violence, terrorism. Ofcourse the rub is, there is differences in what different people and legislations count as terrorism. Somedefinitions include only political motivation. Some wider ideological motivation. Some definitions require acting as part of group, for some mere adherence to ideology is enough. Some require spefic target or for example attacking government. Some defitions require certain indiscriminate nature and causing panic and terror. Some require clear intent to affect specific political change. Etc. Terrorism is one of those tricky legal cases of intent. For example here in Finland a terrorism case just failed to convict on preparing terroristic acts, because court said prosecutor could not show clear evidence of terroristic intent. So  a) the situation is still fluid in Italy, investigation is on going and legal proceedings will be a long process. b) prosecutor might be hesitant to drive for terrorist charges, if they think failure of proving clear enough terroristic intent (in legal meaning) and terroristic nature of the crime might lead to case collapsing.  c) which means they might be driving the case on the more common variety charge of intent to murder to ensure conviction d) what legally happens and what happens in public discourse is two different things. We can debate about the definitions of terrorism. Legal proceedings will follow the definitions of Italian law for what counts as terrorism. ',

Many other attacks followed, some with many victims which were followed by a political declaration and clear Isis affiliation by its makers, some small, made by single men with no clear direct link to Isis, but still imbued with radical Sunni Islam theories. In both cases the countries and Europe treated all this attacks by using counter terrorism methods, because this was the contest of all those attacks anyway. In Italy nothing like this happened in decades, there\'s not an organization advocating for killing blacks or immigrants, and the attacker still hasn\'t pronounced a manifesto or made one.

As far as noon and midnight definitions: they could still be the same, but be independent of the actual numbers. Along with sunrise and sunset, they could be the 4 numbers used in a given area (e.g. cities/towns) to help define where in the time system they fall. Many towns and cities already have such information available for sunrise and sunset; it wouldn\'t be a stretch for them to define their noon and midnight. Instead of adjusting your watch to the local time zone, you would just look up those 4 numbers quick, and you\'re done.',

			'The benefits of this are in larger scale global and extraterrestrial time coordination. A change will be needed eventually if our species continues to spread. Doing conversions all the time will become as messy as everyone having different units for length a few hundred years ago. While the suggestion I had is also imperfect, it removes the need to convert time at all. 14:00 in Sydney is 14:00 in Greenwich is 14:00 in Los Angeles. When coordinating, everyone just gives what time ranges work for them, and a time when all of them are available (e.g. awake and at work) can be easily selected; no conversions necessary. Just like 3 people living in the same town, but with very different schedules. As someone working nights, I can tell you this is quite easy to work with. "My" 07:00 is about 18:00 local time. I would hate to have to convert my "zone" of time to the local one for planning. All parties just understand that 18:00 is evening physically, most people are home or getting home from work, and I\'m leaving for work. And I\'m getting ready for bed around 11:00 local. It\'s pretty easy to get used to. Waaaaay easier than time zones. It\'ll just be shitty during the conversion. Which will be true regardless of how we redefine time measurement for daily use down the road. I\'m also a sailor, and, in general, fuck time zones.',
			'Would it really be easier if, say, Thailand adopted GMT?  Right now if I want to speak to someone in Thailand, I convert the time and go, "okay, I can talk to them at 9:30 am GMT because they\'ll still be in the office."  If they used GMT though, then I\'d have to somehow figure out what point in the day they\'d be in the office. So I\'d still need to look at a conversion chart to know when they\'re likely to be awake.  Which might even be harder to do because there\'s no simple Thai time to convert it into. You\'d need to see a chart of when midday was in, say, Bangkok in GMT and then surely midday would be different within even fairly small geographical areas.  And the natural solution would be to invent time zones. ',
			'ockquote> And the natural solution would be to invent time zones.  Exactly. Timezones suck (especially as a programmer) but they\'re absolutely a solution to a problem. It drives me up the wall when people suggest only going by GMT everywhere would somehow be better, because it makes no sense once you look at it for more than 30 seconds. Standardized time makes sense, noon is noon everywhere, you have an immediate frame of reference when you travel, and you have an immediate frame of reference when you are figuring out the effective time of day for someone halfway across the globe.',
			'In regards to business, they\'re awake. I currently work 1900-0700. I communicate with India on a regular basis. The day shift talks to them at the beginning and end of the shift. It works fine. We don\'t even consider their time, and they ours. But, for tracking events in a global system (which is what we work with, power grids and generation), single time would be amazing. The computers are only as good at converting as the programmers who made them, and there are occasionally issues. There are also frequent issues with documentation from site personnel because of time zones. I personally cover most of North America. I talk to personnel and customers at locations across the country. They all use their own time. With no notation. I have to look up or memorize every single fucking location. Time errors are a definite thing, and have to be fixed. It is a huge waste of time. I\'m also a sailor, and can tell you that a single global time system would be far better for navigation and coordinating with people on land while you are continuously transiting time zones. It\'s horrible, right now. Imagine: I\'m leaving New York, USA at 14:00, it will take (hypothetically) 40 days and 12 hours to get to, let\'s say, Lisbon, Portugal. That means it will be 40 days, plus 12 hours, so you know that you will arrive at 02:00. You can check a quick chart for the sunrise/sunset times (similar to time zones), and you know that roughly what the daylight will be like. Way easier. People in different cultures tend to start and end work at different times, and those times don\'t always sync up with "business" hours in other countries. "Working hours" also becomes a moot point once you go to a 24 hour workplace, which is found in almost every major industry, now, to some degree or another. I do agree, though, that time zones could still play a role. Another comment thread made me realize it. But, I think it would be more productive to primarily use a global timescale, and use a local time zone for casual purposes. This could also be used as an intermediary, and I don\'t just mean for a few years, but longer term. Perhaps it could be implemented, and time zones abolished completely once a large enough portion of humanity is spacefaring. Or something like that.',

Already confused here). As a result depending on your timezone you might have a really vicious outcome. Northern country are mostly affected by this as the sun doesn\'t stay in the sky long during winter. After the last changes in my region... No sunlight after 3PM in winter and sun already visible at 1AM during summer. It\'s like hour early all year long... It\'s pretty awkward. I\'m pretty sure last summer we had a day it felt like the sun was off at 11pm and came back at midnight. Also, all the switching will render most phone automatic time worthless.

With daylight savings it is the best of both worlds, as the sunlight in the winter is 1 hour earlier, relatively (obviously) and 1 hour later in the summer.

Then you come home to A: your paretnts because you still live at home as a grown adult or B: you come home to an unloving family and kids that annoy you. Its a major proble in Japan that the monent famlies have kids they become sexless. Schools raise your kids more than moms and dads. You don\'t really hug and have as much closeness. So moms and schools do most of the work with kids. As you can see stay at work all day that you hate, then come home to kids you barely know and a wife that doesnt put out any more. Thats if you married, but Japan has made it an art to take every aspect of a human relationship and bottle it up and sell it to you. You can buy fake intamcy at a cuddle cafe. You can buy a boyfriend or girlfriend with a virtual GF or BF app on your phone. You can buy dates and company at a host club. Then one day you realize your enitre fucking life is fake and you have nothing real to live for. You work a shit job becuase society told it was your duty. You never stopped and lived one fucking day for yourself! Of course this is not everyone in Japan but a scary number live like this. My nieghbor is 55 or 60 and lives with his 80+ year old parents. I have never seen any friends. over there. He was never married, probably a virgin. Lives in a shitty house. drives a shitty car. The only people he has in the entire world are his mom and dad who he has lived with his entire life. I have never seen any other family come visit. And the never go on vacation. How do you think this guy is going to cope when the only people in his entire life die soon and for the first time at 65 years old he is on his own. And he looks around around at his shitty little life asking himself didnt I try to change something before now? This is an all too common a scenario in Japan. My two yen on the subject. ',

Actually, I think I knew more Japanese after 6 months than I learned in my first 6 years learning English. All in all, I didn\'t find one was harder than the other, the only advantages towards English are I used the same alphabet (but Japanese alphabets are easy to learn and so much more practical than ours, except for kanjis, sucks to learn kanjis) and English is omnipresent in western cultures (music, movies, series, everyday language, even in Japanese where saying an English word with a Japanese accent gives you a 50/50 chance the word exists lol) On the other hand, pronunciation is so much simpler in Japanese.

			'ockquote> Why change get rid of it in the 21st century?  DST has a lot of downsides -- for everyday people, simply the inconvenience of having the clocks change and having to adjust your internal clock, particularly when you lose an hour, and the general downsides of disrupting your sleep cycle (for example, trafic accidents increase following the shift, as do workplace injuries). Various studies have found businesses experience decreased productivity in the days following the clocks-forward change, and since not everyone observes DST, doing business across time-zones can have complications during this shift. The major trade-off was supposed to be that it saves energy as a result of not having to turn the lights on as much, however this has repeatedly been debunked. The most famous study was probably the one that happened in 2006, when several counties in Indiana, which had not previously observed DST, began to do so. Rather than saving energy, those counties actually saw a 1-4% increase in energy usage. So there are real downsides to DST, without any upsides outside of people who simply prefer having more darkness in the morning than the evening.',

Typically stuff that couldn\'t be purchased because it wasn\'t economically viable as a business model for any pharmaceutical company.  For example: ambulatory peritoneal dialysis fluid is basically a sterile isotonic solution, and each patient needs several litres of it a day. The cost of the ingredients is pennies per litre, but it needs to be prepared in an aseptic suite and then autoclaved to ensure it\'s sterile, and then subjected to standard pharmaceutical quality control. So the cost is roughly 99.9% overheads (plant, people, and QA/monitoring) and the product is bulky/heavy to ship around, and there was sod-all profit in it. So the district pharmaceutical service had a small factory, a couple of supervisory pharmacists and lab technicians, and ran a manufacturing operation that probably cost half a million to a couple of million quid per year and kept a district with on the order of half a million people supplied with dialysis fluid (and a bunch of other stuff Glaxo and ICI and Bayer couldn\'t see a profit in manufacturing). I quit the profession in 1990. Some time betwixt then and now, guess what got shut down/downsized in the name of cost-cutting and free market dogma? With results like this. (If a prescription for a custom moisturizer came down — something in the BP or BPC that was well out of patent and not available off-the-shelf — some muggins would get to make it from scratch. Probably 1-2 hours\' work, plus QA and so on. So about 50p for ingredients and £25-50 for labour. But the facility was in-house, so it\'d be billed internally for something like £25.50 to £50.50, without the price-gouging we see here.)',

Red is a preference, the law does not extend to such ridiculous extremes, you\'re taking words out of my mouth. Nobody is harmed by you wearing the colour red, but the harm involved in abusing your position to massively overcharge the taxpayer is obvious. Government isn\'t god? Not sure how that\'s relevant to this. The government is seeing that abuse of a position is taking place, that corporations are not asking for a reasonable amount for a fair exchange of goods and that taxpayers are suffering as a result. Their job is to regulate the market, which is exactly what they\'re threatening to do in response to unfair exchanges taking place. Don\'t start a business to produce and sell the product in this regulated market if it has additional value to you and you will not sell anywhere near it\'s objective value? The cost to produce is objective fact, nobody is making you sell your cream, but just like the law requires the price to be clearly displayed with all costs included, it can also require you to charge a reasonable amount for it. If something more expensive has to be done to produce the cream, obviously that is a factor in how much you can charge. No part of it justifies the insane cost in this situation. ',

For those who want a better more "first class" experience they have the option to go private, you\'ll get your own room and better more personal service in general & better food, but it costs and back in the day private was a luxury option people didn\'t really opt for it unless work had medical cover or they were well off... but that\'s all the difference was, infact if your op goes wrong under private care it is the NHS staff/resources that save your life (for free) while the private staff stand back.

In one farcical situation he was stood in a hospital kitchen cooking NZ-sourced lamb and could see them in the field across from the hospital from the window. It was clear that if contracts had been awarded to local companies, it would have been cheaper and would likely have created jobs due to constant demand as well as meaning less air miles. ',
			'It doesn\'t matter if it\'s not easy, if we\'re talking policy, let\'s do the best thing. The guy quoted here is wrong to try to argue for more government force to be used against businesses. The best option is to let capitalism do its thing, the NHS will have more to choose from and with better quality for cheaper costs. ',
			'Problem is that fundamentally capitalism boils down to one thing- profit and often companies don\'t care how they get it. The historical nature of capitalism has been such that it has relied on the state to provide it with certain protections and powers, but at the same time there exist regulations to keep it in check also for the good of the people- it\'s the reason that I can\'t use lead paint in children\'s toys or dump my toxic waste into rivers. It\'s a balance between corporate freedom and the freedom of the people.  Plus you\'ve got to remember that the NHS is paid from public money. We\'re the first to shout about corporate irresponsibility when private companies squander cash, and yet somehow I\'m supposed to remain silent when the NI money that comes out of my pay each month gets pissed down the drain for completely preventable reasons. The NHS and the public purse is NOT an open cheque book for private companies to take the piss. You only have to look at the US and its retarded healthcare system to see what happens when someone\'s health becomes a profit chasing exercise- costs go up and outcomes become worse. Eventually you\'re going to have to draw a line and introduce some sort of oversight and accountability so that any charge to the NHS can actually be justified. ',
			'Firstly on the capitalism point: Competition leads to the cheaper and higher quality products. In the pursuit of profit, the business will make a product that appeals most to the customer and beats their competitors. This means lowering price and increasing quality as much as possible. I don\'t even know how you can say "the nature of capitalism relies on the state", since capitalism can exist without a state and works best with minimal state intervention. On the oversight point: that\'s perfectly fine? I agree that everything should be reviewed. It\'s not related, it\'s not like I\'m saying the NHS should be free to buy any random crap they want.',
			'It can also lead to monopolies and cartels. Prime example is diamonds- their artificial scarcity is a well-known and demonstrable fact, yet every year people are still falling over themselves to pay vastly inflated sums for them because of slick marketing. Similarly where a company DOES hold monopoly, there is not necessarily an incentive to provide anything of a better service. Over here in the UK one company deals with Internet and fibre infrastructure- result is that outside of major population centres, people who live in rural or sparsely populated areas who cannot pay the exorbitant fees they want for installing cables either don\'t have access to the Internet at all (which impacts upon work, education, tourism and access to services among other things) or rely on very poor service. There\'s even been cases where people opted to install the cables themselves because the company sure as hell wasn\'t going to do it because there was no money in it.   capitalism can exist without a state  On paper, yes. In actual practice, no.   capitalism works best with minimal state intervention   Maybe in the heads of rabid Ayn Rand fanboys. Meanwhile in the real world the intervention of the state at least in the UK means workers get things like a proper minimum wage, 5 weeks holiday a year, union representation and protection against an employer\'s unfair treatment, representation and action in the legal system for work-related cases, maternity and paternity leave and also consumer protections such as blocking monopolies, the establishment of fixed prices for certain commodities, assurances for the suitability and quality of goods sold and a million and one other things.

			'Yeah. I doubt it’s as simple as ‘just changing’ something in a huge organisation, but that does sound like the smart thing to do.',
			'thats not why this is a problem. they are jacking up the prices specifically because the sales are secure and they dont have to compete. they are outside the restrictions of capitalism and the free market, and exploiting it. even worse, this price gouging would almost certainly come after they established this sales channel and the customers back was turned its more like, you could go to a shop and buy ice cream for a few dollars depending what flavour you choose, but your company has a contract with an ice cream shop and gives you a voucher for free ice cream, that they will pay for. they tell you to get at much as you want of any flavour, because a few dollars per ice cream is worth a happy employee. you stop paying attention to the price of ice cream flavours, and the company pays whatever the bill is each month. one month they get charged $2000 per ice cream because the shop suddenly decided that a scoop of vanilla was worth that much, while no other shop in the area charges over a dollar for it. also every shop in the area has the same supplier, so product and cost prices are identical the next month you lose your job because your company paid $200,000 for your ice cream. also you have developed diabetes and dont have health insurance because a similar thing happened with the price of moisturisers',

			'You may have missed mine. I wasn\'t saying that the solution to price hikes is to avoid being locked in, but that being locked in is a scummy reason to hike prices.

I say fuck the company, they are the ones being shitty and acting in bad faith. Their behaviour should be stamped down because it holds back everyone else. ',

I was educated in the UK so I didn\'t have issues - aside from the length of time it took to get my qualifications assessed - but it still amazed me that the standard of my UK education was even in doubt. It\'s kind of crazy that someone who got shit marks at a Canadian uni can walk into a job relatively easily but someone who has a good foreign education and years of experience has to jump through hoops. I\'m not sure what the answer is with respect to how this is assessed for regulated occupations but the current system is failing Canada IMO.',
			'This happened to my family, they were invited to come stay because my uncle was excelling and he had a few choices of countries and chose Canada, Which brought the whole family from egypt.',
			'This is the correct answer.',
			'For me the biggest shocker was not how intelligent they are but their drive. As a kid from a upper middle class that lives in the gta I’ve never found that motivation myself. Even while being on honour roll every year of high school with a high 80 average and passing everything in university (compsci) I feel as though I do it to not disappoint others instead of further myself. I can honestly say majority of these immigrant students make mediocrity feel incompetent and I think that’s due to the newly installed complacency within my generation that’s come with instant gratification and sheltering.',
			'I don\'t know about that for sure. I myself grew up with immigrant parents and so did many of the kids in my area. There\'s definitely tonnes of guilt and this need to not disappoint those around you. It\'s not uncommon for many kid\'s parents to start saving for their college funds at an early age regardless of their chances for a higher education. ',
			'This is incredibly common because it was culturally acceptable to shield your kids from the realities of adult life and raising a family. You never saw how hard your parents worked because they hid it form you but they absolutely worked their asses off. That sentiment is changing, its ok to show your kids how you work to achieve things and the failure/success that comes with.',
			'Why isn\'t that the case in Europe though, where many kids of certain cultural backgrounds severely lack behind in education?',
			'It is mainly because, in Canada the migration is merit based. I recently migrated to Canada. I have an Engineering degree and 4 years experience as a software engineer in my home country.',
			'Canada is somewhat of an island. We have a well funded(comparatively) immigration bureau that can be demanding to get past - we want people who want to be here ',
			'I don’t expect you to have the absolute answer but why does the US get shit on for not letting everyone in? ',
			'As an example, when Canada is looking at immigrants or refugees from muslim countries, we favour education and families. When we bring in families, we try to position them in small communities and integrate them. This is possible because of a well funded immigration program - generally these families are well accepted in their communities, and the communities want them to succeed. We try to pull in full families all at once.',
			'what was the process like?',
			'It is lengthy and you have to get really good marks for the Language test exam. It took me more than 12 months for the whole process to complete. ',
			'My guess is Canada\'s merit system. Or maybe you are comparing immigrants and refugees, because immigrants typically are required to be educated and often middle class whereas refugees, generally speaking, are lower class and come from rural families and often come with baggage',
			'Why don\'t we model our USA immigration system after Canada? They seem to have their shit together. A merit based system that favors highly educated applicants. ',
			'The U.S should adopt Canada’s system. Clearly immigration reform is needed. But instead of framing it as “We need a system like Canada has”, it’s “We’d rather have people from Norway instead of shithole countries”.  Immigration reform honestly doesn’t have to be that complicated but neither side wants to compromise.  Give Dreamers and those with protections a path to citizenship with the same standards as other applicants. Just waive the clause where they have to leave the country first.  End the lottery and focus on a merit based system.  The lottery is useless in the sense that even if someone wins, if they don’t meet the qualifications they don’t get a green card anyways. ',
			'When I came to Canada the country and most people in it accept me. The country offered a comfortable and fast (4 years) path to citizenship. I was told Canada is multicultural and I should feel free in being an Afghan Canadian. I didn\'t feel rejected. I didn\'t seek a ghetto to belong to. My connection with Afghanistan did not ostracized me from Canadian society. I faced of course many types and cases of racism but the feeling of acceptance was stronger. I self confidently chose then to enter Canadian society in a professional capacity rather than choosing to work a cash job, in a insulated community. In my experience European immigrants don\'t get that opportunity.',
			'Thanks for saying that. There are many Canadians like me (60F)who welcome immigrants. I lived in southeast Asia for four years, so I know what it is like to feel foreign.  As a rule, I don\'t equate anyone with the stereotypes from their culture. They have already left it. I became an ESL teacher so I could explain Canadian culture and language to newcomers.  Our true culture is empathy and acceptance, at least I hope so. My ancestors came here from England, on both sides, and my husband\'s came from Ireland during the potato famine. Welcome. We can build a better Canada together. ',
			'Thanks. I absolutely agree. I plan to raise my future family here as Canadians and teaching them first and foremost those same values of empathy and acceptance.',
			'Great to hear about your experience. I\'m Canadian but live in the US. My kid was born in the US, making her an American citizen. Yet, my American friends still consider her to be Canadian and not American. It\'s odd.  Trudeau welcoming \'home\' Syrian refugees makes me tear up every time. ',
			'Yep! That\'s exactly it.',
			'You’ve never met Asian parents in the UK? They demand all their kids become lawyers or doctors.',
			'Same in the US, definitely when I was in college in the 90\'s. The joke then, that pretty much every kid in school would immediately "get", was that in practically every class there was an Asian kid who\'d get perfect marks on everything and screw up the grading curve for everyone else.  I found that to be entirely true studying business and accounting, though I admired it rather than resented it.',
			'Yeah, where is this guy living? No English son of a taxi driver or convenience store owner would ever go to uni- but every single Asian child in that family would. The emphasis on “tooshun” is absolute. Or you get the beats.',
			'Because to get a Visa to Canada you have to have skills, almost like a merit based system, or something else. Many of my friends are in Canada and they have to be in demand. To get into Europe , you just have to have legs',
			'To get into Europe , you just have to have legs lol',
			'Canada is surrounded by water, USA and ice. The obvious result for that is that the number of refugees is so small that it can be pretty much ignored. What\'s left are the immigrants that enter due to their merit system. The people that enter like this are all educated and they came from countries that are worse off. Educated parents are more likely to have kids that end up doing well in school and them being from a worse off country means that they know how good they have it now and put more pressure on their children to do good in school. Europe on the other hand is connected to too many countries. Be it the middle east, africa (by boat), Turkey, Russia, etc. These countries can also all be unsafe for people, and some European countries won\'t send back refugees that may get killed. (For example, a gay Saudi arriving in Germany won\'t be send back to Saudi Arabia) This causes many poor people to arrive in Europe, often with little education. And when they arrive in Germany then everything is new to them, they don\'t even understand the language. The numbers are also often way higher than those in Canada. Thus these people form groups with similar immigrants, because that way they can be among similar people, which is something they\'re used to. This however causes the integration to be lacking. Especially considering how many refugees arrived in Europe recently. (They\'re refugees, but I doubt that many of them will leave) Of course, in Europe there are also immigrants similar to those in Canada. It may be someone that arrived in Germany to go to university, since his country doesn\'t have any good ones and ended up staying afterwards, for example after finding a significant others. People like them are often from a better background and are well educated. They generally integrate better. TL;DR: Few high educated immigrants integrate better than many with lacking education.',
			'That may be true, but Canada works hard to integrate its immigrants and refugees. ESL classes, training programs, and a lack of discrimination that I know exists all over Europe.  I had a German friend that absolutely hated Turks. She said that German employers would hire a German over a Turk every time because they knew the German would always be on time.  Canada isn’t free from discrimination but it’s mainly “can you speak English well enough to the job”. ',
			'Many of these different circumstances come from the different situations. For example, your point about discrimination. Isn\'t that the result of an issue with integration and education? And the issue that Europe has with integration and education I\'ve already explained above. Europe also has support for immigration, but don\'t forget that the people that arrive are completly different. As Europe has more immigrants and less educated ones, the integration would obviously become more difficult. I do however know that the ones in Europe are currently way over capacity. And the most important point for integration isn\'t the help systems in place, but the will of the person involved. It can only show people the door, but they need to go through it themselves.',
			'The Chinese families that come to Canada are largely from the top 10% socioeconomically in China. The refugees that come to Europe are largely from the bottom 50%. If you take people from the bottom 50% of China you would see similar trends. Not to mention China is a more well off country in general that the African or Middle Eastern nations those refugees come from. The top 10% of China will have better socioeconomic metrics than the top 10% from those nations.',
			'Maybe that top 10% from China is the new trend because most of the children of Chinese immigrants from my cohort (early to mid twenties) come from rather poor socioeconomic backgrounds. The stereotype Asian parent who wants you to be frugal and wants you to get a good education didn\'t pop up in response to wealthy Chinese immigrants (or maybe its a Cantonese thing).',
			'No. This is the case. Rich kids don\'t value higher education nor do their parents unless they\'re getting into politics/politically inclined or want the respect of normies. The top 10% of China isn\'t contributing to the stats of Canada, they have it good in China and stay just having properties in multiple locations overseas.  The people going to school want jobs, they don\'t have family money ususally. ',
			'ockquote> Rich kids don\'t value higher education   I talk to a lot of rich Asians from Vancouver everyday, not only are they highly educated but still work Full time and even two jobs. They\'re hardworking regardless of how much money they or their parents have.',
			'The kids references are from my generation or so. The big mass migration from China happened in the 80s a d it was a lot of poorer southerners like my family. Your thinking of more recent stats when Canada tightened it\'s rules enormously under Harper. ',
			'Because  A) You can\'t just take a boat to canada from the middle east. B) We have less strict rules about who to accept in. C) A lot of the people who come here aren\'t planning on living here for their whole lives. D) Language barriers with countries who doesn\'t use english as their main language. ',
			'ockquote> D) Language barriers with countries who doesn\'t don\'t use english as their main language.  I\'m definitely being pedantic here, but in the context of what you\'re arguing it had to be corrected.',
			'I had a similar experience in my school as well. We had an IB program at the time and it was something I didn\'t even think about until meeting those who really did. I didn\'t realize how much I took my school for granted until getting to know some of the others in my class who were immigrants. ',
			'I\'ve personally befriended at least half a dozen immigrants that came here because their parents wanted a better life for their family. Not only do the parents do well in staying out of poverty, the friends I\'ve made all seem to be taking advantage of what they simply never had in their home country. Countless, and I mean countless opportunities for them to succeed here in Canada. They\'re all hard workers too, it\'s not just their grades that do exceedingly well, it\'s their ambition. I\'ve worked with them, socialized and went on trips. They are certainly grateful of what this country has to offer them, and they are gracious enough to apply themselves and find a way to pay it back. I\'m Native American and I welcome foreigners to this land. Yet a lot of my peers and family who don\'t strive for anything in life are discontent with immigrants working here or getting educated. I have some white friends who take on the "Trump" mentality towards foreigners, it pisses me off, this is Canada. This is my ancestor\'s homeland. I personally don\'t mind immigrants, they do well and I envy their hardships. ',
			'The US needs to emulate Canada\'s immigration system.',
			'For one, Canada isn\'t bordered by Mexico which dramatically simplifies their immigration debate. ',
			'As much as I think this is an uplifting story I also can\'t help but think geography is also a big factor. This is also a thing in the EU. Immigrants should apply in the country they first arrive in. Needless to say a lot of countries at the borders of the EU aren\'t thrilled. Those boats from Africa aren\'t going to land in central/northwestern countries. They always land in the Mediterranean countries. Eventually they split up the burden that comes with housing, education, etc., but in the meanwhile the border countries have no choice but to deal with it immediately. Arranging temporary housing, food, security, medical care, screening people.. Unfortunately there is little to do about it except for helping to provide those countries with the means to handle it, since you can\'t very well change geography.',

Would herds of this size have contributed to warming? Do we just have so much more cattle on earth now than natural populations of similar animals with similar diets?',
			'So there are a few issues with why cows produce so much methane and co2 as opposed to the millions and millions of other mammals that were around he pre-industrial revolution.  The feed they eat is corn-based, which is a cost (and arguably taste) based decision. Their stomachs didn’t evolve to digest grain so they release more gases. The pastureland they are raised on when they do eat grasses (most cows start eating grasses and move to grains to be fattened up for slaughter) have been stripped of the original perennial prairie grasses in favor of annual, short root and cheap grasses. The cattle aren’t sufficiently rotated on the pastureland, so they are allowed to completely strip a field of grass, causing nutrients and carbon to wash out during rains into the streams and rivers, adding to the carbon emissions and removing the nutrients that would allow stronger and more sustainable plants to grow.  There are some new farming practices (literally called carbon farming) that involve pure grass fed beef, with perennial grasses, such as chicory, that have deep tap roots that can keep carbon in the soil. This combined with rotation that allows the grasses to recover actually has the potential to completely neutralize the carbon emissions of livestock. Look up the marin carbon project if you want to know more.',

I tried to explain that almost all of those spikes were either recovery after a cooling event (like a meteor strike) or periods of high volcanic activity and the natural cycle changes (like sun activity) measured in fractions of a degree per millennia.

			'Hello there! If you\'re reading this post, you may be interested in reducing your impact on the environment. There are some easy steps that you can take to help the environment. 1. Say No to Straws Seriously, just say no. They’re an unnecessary disposable plastic that ultimately just ends up polluting more than the personal convenience is worth. You can drink from the glass, and if you really like straws you can buy reusable ones made of metal, glass, or bamboo.  2. Stop using plastic bottles Water is great, but disposable bottles are not. Metal, glass, and hard plastic water bottles are all great for filling up with tap water and carrying in your bag. If you don’t like the taste of tap water, you can always buy a filtering pitcher or a filtering attachment for certain water bottles. In most parts of the country it is easier to recycle aluminum and glass than plastic. So next time you buy a non-water drink please consider buying one that’s packaged in a can or in a glass bottle.  3. Ditch disposable plates and utensils If you use disposable plates and utensils on a daily basis, please buy a real plate. You can find them at any thrift shop if you feel you can’t afford it. If you’re using disposables because you don’t like washing dishes, it only takes about 10 minutes. As for utensils at fast food restaurants or food trucks you can bring metal ones from home and wash them at home. 4. Go Outside Not only does being near nature make you happier, it helps to remind us all of why we should care about the environment. 5. Think before you buy Before you buy anything, you should think “Do I really need this?”. In addition to saving the environmental cost of resource extraction, manufacturing, and shipping, it will also save you money.  6. Try to line dry clothes When it’s warm and not humid outside, line drying saves you money in electricity. Your clothes will also smell nice and setting up a line isn’t difficult. 7. Try meatless mondays Animal agriculture is pretty bad for the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, water use, etc. I know most people aren’t up for a completely vegan lifestyle, so try being vegetarian once a week. It’ll reduce your carbon footprint and you’ll probably end up trying new foods. 8. Try reusable produce bags They\'re easy to sew yourself, but if that isn\'t your cup of loose-leaf tea you can buy them online or at some stores. This will reduce the 3-4 plastic produce bags you probably use every time you go grocery shopping. Its small, but adds up over time If you got down here, thanks for reading! Every step counts, and your good example and lead others to make positive changes as well. ',

			'ockquote> And from talking to the people at occupy central when it was in full swing, these aren\'t people that are spoiled and whining for more privileges.  That is what is most dangerous about them. They are idealists and are fighting for their ideals and not anything material. Unfortunately when their ideals are unrealistic and impractical, all this achieves is making the situation worse. I\'ve spoken to many of them. They are all basically of the opinion that while they have no chance of winning, it is better than fight than to sit back and accept the situation. Unfortunately this is where I disagree because I think fighting makes things even worse. It gives China an excuse to take control and take drastic measures. China isn\'t that interested in taking control of Hong Kong - we\'re just not that important. They\'ll implement some farcical democratic system to keep some satisfied and retain face, and they\'ll make sure they\'re in control, however they\'re fine with HK governing themselves for the most part if things run smoothly.

This became their default strategy for everything despite what they education taught them.  Reddit wants to blame quality of education every problem but it isn\'t the root. The root of the problem is quality of people being educated. ',
			'If the two options (protests vs. effecting change while in a governmental position) were both equally possible, I would agree that doing it the legal way may be better. The issue is that getting to a position in the government while believing in maintaining HK autonomy, at least until 2047, and HK culture is quickly looking to be impossible.  I disagree that all supporters of occupy central were raised throwing tantrums outside malls for mainly personal reasons such as knowing them or their parents (not the kind of people who would put up with tantrums, and I suspect anyone with Asian parents would know what I\'m talking about ;) ). But even if that were true, judging a political ideal or philosophy based on the actions of its supporters seems a tad illogical. Should we not be judging it on its own merits, on how it could benefit the society in which it is applied? ',

			'Anyone who makes a peremptory statement about what Beijing will do in Hong Kong across the long-term is an idiot. LOL.  China doesn\'t have much interest in imposing the same types of controls and restrictions that exist in other cities upon Hong Kong, given that the chief reason for its immense success as an international financial hub are openness and rule of law. This is huge, hugely esteemed by Beijing. China itself is going to change immensely over the next few decades in any case. ',
			'You aren\'t wrong, but you should realize what this means for Hong Kong in this case, a country/city that used to enjoy an actual democracy. So mind you I\'m someone who does business in China for over 2 decades. You don\'t realize how intrusive a totalitarian government is till you actually get close in touch with it. Now for the vast majority of the local population that are good citizens this has no impact obviously. Though visit for example Xinjiang, I had to be there the other day. To begin you can\'t just go there you need special papers. Upon arrival you will see very other block a heavy police truck. When arrived I was kindly asked to come over to the police station which never happened before. People are being actively constantly harassed by the police up to house visitations and checking their mobiles. It\'s also said that over 100.000 locals are in "re-education" camps. These camps hold you basically for indefinite and aren\'t any different then the Russian Gulachs.  Hong Kong on the other hand was a flourishing little city thanks to democracy. Mind you prior it was nothing but a tiny fishing village. Though without question it will become a sub-urb of Shenzhen and all those little perks it had will be torn down. It will become a city of nothing. And that\'s what local people obviously aren\'t waiting for. But it has to be said, I think a large chunk already left. Like my own inlaws left when the UK left right on that spot and only came back renting occasionally a property so they could quickly leave if needed. Nobody trusts the Chinese government for good reasons. It will destroy Hong Kong and it\'s population.',

They can always cross the border and embrace the happiness and freedom under the gentle hand of Great Leader Putin.  In fact, the original reason they received heavy hand control from China was not because of Radical Islamic terror, but an armed revolt on behalf of the USSR.  Funny how the Hui Muslims were allowed to have open Sharia Court, women only Mosques, tax exemption and affirmative action, but Uygur get the hammer all the time. ',
			'> a country/city that used to enjoy an actual democracy Hong Kong on the other hand was a flourishing little city thanks to democracy   For almost all of its history under British rule, executive power in Hong Kong was concentrated in the hands of the colony governor, a position appointed by the British crown without any democratic input from Hong Kong citizens. The introduction of elected representatives determined by local elections, even limited to the role of "advisory councils", did not begin until after the 1984 agreements by the British to hand Hong Kong over to China.  You have never done business in China, and certainly not for over 2 decades You have never been to Xinjiang, and certainly were not there the other day You have never had any inlaws from Hong Kong, and certainly not any who changed to UK nationality before the handover Nobody trusts your comment for good reasons.',

			'The fact that you claimed you did biz in China and still called a totalitarian country means you are bullshitting. China is no means democratic but it is a far, far outcry from being totalitarian, which essentially means government dictating every aspect of a citizen’s life, which is clearly not the case in China.  As for Xinjiang, the so called re-education camp is more like de-radicalization centre and the comparison with gulag is fucking absurd. ',

			'For those too lazy to do the very basic research on this before shitposting: Govt of HK under British rule: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Hong_Kong Govt of HK now: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Hong_Kong  I\'ll summarize for those to lazy to bother reading: HK, being a colony, was ruled by a governor appointed by London. No office in the entire colonial govt was elected by the locals, not one. Now we have a legislature and an executive office. Both are elected by locals. The legislature is elected by universal suffrage. The Chief Executive (our President) is elected by an electoral college of 1200 people, local academics, business leaders etc. The Umbrella Movement wasn\'t to "bring democracy to HK". You can\'t bring us something we already have. They were protesting Beijing\'s new power to veto candidates for the Presidential race, a power they never actually exercised. There was some support for the kids leading this movement back in 2014, but now no one with a full time job supports them. We just had another round of Presidential elections and Beijing didn\'t veto anyone and it went just like it always does. Except we elected a lady, a first for us. The Umbrella kids lost any remaining support when their two pro-independence Legco (our Congress) members trolled their own swearing ceremony by calling Chinese people "Shina", which is a Japanese racial slur for all Chinese people (including HKers). This got them disqualified (obviously). Now these kids are asking for the release of documents regarding the 1967 riots (that\'s what the article is about if you bothered to read it, which I\'m sure most of you did not). I have no idea why seeing as how those riots were an anti-colonial uprising against the British. The rumor is that the PLA almost invaded HK to support the protesters but no one know for sure, the PLA isn\'t the type of organization that announces their intentions to the public. ',
			'Best comment in the thread.',
			'Not hard to do in literally any piece of news that doesn\'t involve the US. It\'s appalling how strong people are in their convictions on topics that they know literally nothing about.',
			'I would agree with the vast majority of the above, however, you have somewhat played down the importance of the group and the political leaning of the \'Election Committee\' which you refer to as the electoral college.  Whilst I wouldn\'t disagree with the point that it includes local academics and business leaders, the members of the EC are broadly regarded to be sympathetic to the mainland government particularly due to the influence the mainland has on the economy and business interests of the territory (and those in the committee). In this respect, those which where proponents of the Umbrella Movement felt that their section of society where underrepresented within this cross section utilised to elect the Chief Executive.  The previous Chief Executive, Leung Chun-Ying, was widely unpopular with the electorate.  Thanks. ',
			'ockquote> the members of the EC are broadly regarded to be sympathetic to the mainland government particularly due to the influence the mainland has on the economy and business interests of the territory (and those in the committee).  And?  If you do business with mainland China, as nearly all HK businesses do, wouldn\'t you be in favor of facilitating that business? These people also employ most everyone in HK, including me. I\'d like for my company to keep doing well, call me crazy.',
			'No I wouldn\'t dare call you crazy, all I\'m pointing out is that there is another layer to your position beyond that which you cared to elaborate.  I would point out that there are interests beyond that of the strictly economic which should have a voice in such a group. It\'s static nature also provides far more power to certain factions of industry. Agriculture and Fisheries, for example, have 60 seats where the sector only makes up less than 1% of the entire economy of Hong Kong, thus not being broadly representative of HKSAR\'s economic realities.  (aside) My firm also conducts a lot of business with Chinese firms, I too have interest in close relations with China. That interest should not be confused with a wish to see that the people of Hong Kong have a proper representation in the electoral system and as such facilitate fair elections which represent the electorate.  That\'s my only point, I feel this aspect of the Committee should be shared for completeness and correctness. Thank you very much for the above reply, you seemed to have done much to educate people on the nature of democracy in Hong Kong. I hope my addition facilitates further discussion and enhances understanding of the political landscape in Hong Kong with as little bias as possible.  Thanks for reading. ',
			'The sad fact is that the vast majority of people who comment on this thread have no idea what\'s going on and he MSM doesn\'t seem interested in ever providing any background when they report on this topic.  I\'m guessing\'t it\'s because the "brave, freedom loving, students fighting for democracy against evil Chinese communist dictatorship" meme sells a lot better than what\'s actually going in reality. It says a lot about why it\'s a better idea to restrict the pool of people who are given the privilege to vote. The average person just isn\'t capable of understanding the complex issues of the modern world.',
			'Hong Kong was run like a dictatorship by the Brits until Deng made it clear to Thatcher China was getting HK back even if they had to march the PLA in. Overnight, the British suddenly became concerned with democracy and human rights they had never previously extended to the people of HK. Funny how that happened.',
			'As an actual HK citizen, I have to wonder how many of the commentators here know the first thing about HK\'s current govt vs. what we have prior to 1997.',
			'I am also from HK, and my opinion is that HK never had democracy under British rule, so it is strange for it to ask for democracy now that they are under Chinese rule.  No British governor of HK was ever democratically elected, ever. ',
			'ockquote> my opinion is that HK never had democracy under British rule  Not really an opinion; that\'s a fact. The governors were literally appointed by the Queen of England herself. I don\'t know why this is such a controversial fact these days, it\'s not exactly ancient history and a couple of the ex-governors are still alive FFS.',
			'It might be strange, I agree, but HK is not wrong to value democracy.',
			'Tell us. You live there.',
			'We already have democracy here. I know, since I voted last year. We even elected our first female President. Before 1997 our governors were appointed by London. These kids are bitching about literally nothing.',
			'ockquote> President.   She\'s the Chief Executive, we don\'t have a president.',
			'I\'m trying to make this "accessible" for Americans.',
			'ockquote> We even elected our first female President.  LOL',
			'ockquote> We even elected our first female President.  "We"?',
			'Tell us your opinion. ',
			'And damage their relationship with China? why would they do that?',
			'I\'m not sure what exactly in particular these activists are looking for from the achieve. Some of the more fundamental questions, like why the colonial Government didn\'t prepare HK for democracy earlier, have already been addressed (because CCP threatened with force and the British knows HK is very hard to defend geographically, especially the colony is so far from homeland). The folks at Hong Kong Watch have mentioned about the possibility of granting British Citizenship\'s rights to holders of British National Oversea passport. It may still be very far fetched but at least not as far fetched as realizing a democratic Hong Kong through disclosing archive files.',
			'Moreover, I\'m willing to bet there\'s a fair amount of dirty laundry in those files and that Britain would rather avoid the embarrassment. This ideal of a democratic Hong Kong never really existed in actuality, and by some metrics, such as percentage of population with suffrage, HK is more democratic than it was under the British. ',
			'Then it begs the question of what these activists want to do with these dirty laundry. Care to enlighten us on that? Please don\'t tell me they want to blackmail the Brits.',
			'They probably haven\'t considered that, I think they more or less operate under the idea that any publicity is good publicity. ',
			'The U.K. that\'s in the progress of leaving the EU because of immigration issues granting millions the right to immigrate to the UK. Now that\'s a grand fantasy above the hope that documents will stop China. ',
			'The irony is that Hong Kong was ruled by racially appointed despotic governors until it was transferred to Chinese control. It does not have a history of democratic rule under the United Kingdom. If the PRC instituted the English system used to govern Hong Kong while it was occupied, there would be an outcry. At least it is no longer racially subjugated.',
			'which is why i chuckle at these activists in HK. you can bet they weren\'t trying this hard to wriggle out of UK rule when they were a colony. ',
			'The irony is that the documents these kids are asking for refer to the 1967 riots when the HKer tried to rise up against British rule. Spoiler alert: it didn\'t work',
			'most of these activists where sperms when HK was a British colony',
			'They probably weren\'t even sperm yet. They were nothing, not even their dads\' sperm yet.',
			'During British rule the police will smash your head with a stick if you refuse to clear off. Not a lot of people seem to remember those days unfortunately. ',
			'A truncheon by any other name is still a truncheon. ',
			'No, just you know, Despotically Subjugated',
			'You know what this would do? This would just give even more ammo for pro-CCP/mainland media for further proof that these so-called "pro-democracy" activist are actually "pro-western", and give the Chinese government\'s position nationalism support. But most people in this thread probably won\'t understand it and just upvote because they saw "democracy".',
			'naive',
			'Why the fuck should China care whether the legal documents from some hostile foreign government illegally annexing and occupying their land say? This is utterly bizarre. It\'s like Polish separatists saying they want legal documents from occupying Nazi Germany to prove their part of the country isn\'t really Polish. Bizarre.',
			'It was immoral for the British to annex Hong Kong. How was it illegal? That\'s a somewhat modern concept. I\'m not aware of any international law forbidding annexation 1841.',
			'China, the sovereign ruler over Hong Kong, did not willingly give control over the region to the British. You think China didn\'t have laws forbidding hostile powers to invade their country at that time?',
			'ockquote> China, the sovereign ruler over Hong Kong  Yes and China became ruler of Hong Kong by illegally annexing it. And so on and so forth back in time. You can talk about whether annexation/invasion is right or wrong, but debating it\'s legality is pointless.',
			'It is currently illegal to annex territory under Article 2 clause 4 of the United Nations Charter, which is in force today:  All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations  As far as I know, no such international laws existed in the 1840s. There\'s an important distinction between international law (the laws governing interactions between multiple sovereign nations) and domestic laws (the laws by which sovereign nations govern themselves). That\'s why I wrote that it was immoral, but not illegal. It wasn\'t illegal under British law, or international law, for the British to annex HK.  If sovereign foreign countries were subject to the domestic laws passed unilaterally by other countries, then the British could have just passed a law through their parliament declaring Hong Kong to be theirs, and that would be the end of it. Obviously that\'s silly, which is why they had to make the Chinese sign a peace treaty with them. It was brutal and immoral; based on the "might-makes-right" mentality of the day; and it certainly would be illegal in modern times under international law, but it was not illegal back then. ',
			'ockquote> illegally annexing and occupying  The whole point of annexing or invading land is that it\'s illegal. If you can get what you want legally, there\'s no need to march in the army and occupy territory. I agree China is unlikely to care, though.',
			'I dislike that I am pointing this out but no amount of "unseen files" are going to stop a military superpower like China from exerting its will on Hong Kong.',
			'That would make sense if it wasnt that the same military of China is the fucking same military of Hong Kong. China doesnt need military force, they already got hong kong by the balls. The reason why hong kong is so successful is bc most of the goods from china go through hong kong. And the independent movement is not popular in hong kong, most of them are just students with no job that want to be che guevarra. ',
			'It\'s funny because like you said, HK rose to its wealth because it served as a trading city between China and much of the rest of the world. Today, its economy is strong but that\'s basically because of Chinese goods flowing through there still. HK as an independent city state wouldn\'t last at all, no matter how much they dream of it. Forget talking about a strong economy. How are they even going to get power and clean drinking water?',
			'Hows Macau doing compared to Hong Kong in all of this?',
			'They have 9000 MOP (~1100 UD) hush money annually going for them, so that\'s nice.',
			'I lived in China ~6 years, Hong Kong 1 year, and Macau 6 months. Go to Hong Kong and call taxi drivers Chinese, they\'ll say "No, I\'m HongKongnese". Go to Macau and ask them if they\'re from Macau and they\'ll say they\'re from China.',
			'Macau largely liberated itself even before it was repatriated to China. In 1967 there was a rash of riots in HK as people tried to rise up against colonial rule. But it was crushed by the British. In Macau, they tried the same thing a few years later. Unlike the British, the Portuguese just threw up their arms and were like "OK, you guys win".',
			'"Macanese people" in Macau refers to a minority of mixed Chinese and Portuguese descent',
			'TIL that galinha à africana has a lot of Chinese, European Portuguese, and colonial Portuguese influence in one dish.',
			'What would that do? So the former drug pushing imperialist tenant had bunch of old papers that may make Beijing look bad to the foreign world, as if Beijing would care your former colonialist friends\'s view.  These bunch of lazy Starbucks revolutionaries are pathetic and cowardice, since when any revolution can succeed on outsiders\' goodwill? Or maybe they are just running low on domestic support. ',
			'They are not lazy Starbucks revolutionists. They have and are still taking direct and daring action against the Chinese government from protests to forming government parties, running in elections etc. They also do have a lot of supporters. So I definitely wouldn\'t call them cowardly.  That\'s what\'s most dangerous about them though, they\'re brave, reckless and idealistic, and hence have no regard for practical consequences. IMO this sort of thing is what will destroy Hong Kong. Trying to push an ideal with no regard for practicality never ends well. ',
			'Don\'t know about the first part, totally agree with your second part, and that\'s why I\'m skeptical about these.  The fact is that the only thing they\'ve achieved so far is set Hong Kong\'s economy back at least a decade, which in term translate to job losses, and it\'s the lower tier majority of the society suffer most.',
			'This isn\'t going to happen, and even if it does it\'s unlikely to lead to anything that the activists think it will. No nation has the balls to risk trade relations by going up against China directly, the current status of Taiwan has already proven this. ',
			'As a Hongkonger: If any HKers here who still feel \'british\' need proof that they never gave a shit about us and only saw us as 2nd class in the first place, well just watch this space.',

			'Exactly this. The party only rules and dominates. It does not negotiate, and will never allow any real freedom. There is an Emperor again. One called the Central Party.',

			'Guess that news about China no longer willing to take in foreign trash really resonated with you huh?',

			'Yes, they’ve lied the “one country two systems” lie several times. There are Taiwanese people who see China\'s prosperity and want a piece.',

			'There\'s not a quick and easy answer.  There have been bad acts from both sides. The modern conflict stems from the aftermath of WWII, the Holocaust and the UK relinquishing its\' colonies. The UN established a committee which produced a report (in 1947) that advised a division of the area and creating an internationally governed area for Jerusalem. The Israelis accepted the result, the Palestinians did not as they wished for a single state for the entire area. Now, Israelis had already been moving to the area prior to that but after that report a civil war broke out (1947-1948) and in May that year the Israelis declared their independence. After that, well.. a lot more bloodshed and misery followed. As an outsider it is far more interesting to see how one might improve the situation bit by bit instead of seeing the situation deteriorate.  As it stands, Israel clearly has far more power and if allowed to continue, the right-wing governments may end up diminishing the Palestinians\' remaining land and power to the effect that they do not need to fear anything the Palestinians might attempt. That last bit is speculation of course. I would think it is imperative that both peoples end up having a place to live in peace and prosperity and to realise that (if it is at all possible) Israel needs to unilaterally take the first steps (which probably requires accepting at least some amount of risk). And that with time, patience and continued attempts to normalise relations between the peoples the Palestinians may see that they have a greater chance of living a normal life with decent facilities who knows..? I mean, this conflict has been going for a long time, but I imagine that regular people on either side would prefer to just be able to lead a normal life. And I\'d say they deserve it. -edit- I mean, it\'s not as if I mean to suggest that the resentment, fear, anger, loss, traumas and stories will be easily gone and forgotten. But still, what can one do other than try?',
			'Not a bad summary though I\'d point out 2 things:   There already was a functioning Jewish proto-state decades before th Holocaust. The Holocaust certainly brought many around to supporting the idea of a Jewish state, the only reason Israel came into being was because Jews declared statehood and then won the war that was forced on them. Israel already tried unilateralism twice: first when it withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000 and then again when it withdrew from Gaza & 4 settlements in Samaria in 2005. Israelis then went to the polls and voted in Kadima, a party whose sole reason for being was to replicate the Disengagement in the west bank. However then the Palestinians went to the polls and voted in Hamas and shortly after that Hezbollah started the Second Lebanon War.   Israel does have more power so it is reasonable to expect it to take risks for peace. However most Israelis don\'t see why they should keep taking the same risks when each time they do they are rewarded not with peace but more war from a less advantageous position. ',

			'Important: Keep in mind that when I say Arabs, Zionists, Jews, Palestinians, Israelis, etc. I\'m not talking about all of them all the time. For example, when I say that Muslims attacked Israelis, then it doesn\'t mean that all Muslims were involved. Just that from the Muslims some attacked some Israelis. edit: More important things: I did try to be as impartial with this as I could. However, after reading through it I did realize that some parts do not appear very impartial. Also keep in mind that I tend to talk more about less known things, while I\'m more prone to skip over well known parts. This means that I\'ll often talk in more detail about what Zionists/Israelis did, as quite frankly their propaganda in the West was very effective. edit: Jews were discriminated against around the whole world. It wasn\'t anything unique to Nazi Germany, in fact it existed well before Nazis and continued even after WW2. Zionists came to Palestine to make their own country. (edit: There were also Arab immigrants coming Palestine. The "Palestine" I\'m talking about is the geographical location.) Before that movement started the Ottoman Empire also ramped up the registration of land ownership. Before that few people had their own land even registered and even with this coming many didn\'t register their land except when it was needed. (For example when selling it) Sadly this process was frought with corruption, causing both Ottoman officials and some individual Palestinians to register land under their name that wasn\'t actually theirs. At first this wasn\'t really a big issue, but then the Zionists came with a lot of money. Some of them bought land, which resulted in native Palestinians suddenly losing all their land and the Zionists drove them out. Causing them to live in caves. This obviously caused hate to accumulate between the groups, especially between Muslims and Zionists. The native Jews were also driven into the conflict, as some Muslims didn\'t differentiate between them. This caused both sides to mount attacks on each other. There were, for example, reports of Zionists bragging about how they beat up Palestinians. And the conflict grew worse over time, causing blood to spill at some point as more and more Zionists arrived. (edit: To clarify, while I did talk more about Zionists attacking Palestinians, as far as I know, most of the attacks were done by Muslims against Jews. I did talk more about Zionists, especially the ones that were unprovoked, because they were less know.) The owner of that land wasn\'t really important, so I won\'t get into to much detail of that. At first it was the Ottoman Empire, then Britain. Britain had enough of it and let the UN deal with it. Then came the UN partition plan. Well... The plan was largely supported by Zionists. US was supporting the Zionist movement and putting pressure on other countries to support the UN partition plan. Zionists also threatened and bribed other countries, which was quite easy sometimes considering that many were in need of loans after the big war. Obviously the Muslim natives wouldn\'t agree to losing more than half their land. Zionists declared independence, creating Israel. And the Muslims declared war. However, the Muslims were much worse equipeed than the Israelis, resulting in the loss in the war. Both sides comitted massacres during the war, but the Muslim side was worse in it. Many Muslims fled their homes during the war, since they didn\'t want to get killed. After the war ended the Muslims that fled their homes weren\'t allowed to return home and Israel confiscated their homes and gave them to Israelis. This created the so called "Palestinian refugees". I\'m not that knowledgeable about what happened next, so I\'ll just skip to the recent to now situation. After the wars Israel now occupies West Bank and Gaza is fully under Palestinian control. In West Bank the Palestinian party Fatah is in power, while in Gaza it\'s Hamas. West Bank is split into 3 zones. Area A, B and C. Area C is the biggest, being 61% of West Bank. Area C is being controlled by Israel. They get to decide who gets building permits. And sadly, the Palestinians find it pretty much impossible to get any building permits. This is why you often read about how classrooms, etc. get demolished by Israel, because they can\'t legally build them. They can\'t even renovate them without a permit. Water is also being supplied by Israel. The Water is being pumped out in occupied territory, and currently the Palestinian farmer barely get anything. This obviously caused agriculture to fall sharply. I think it fell by like 40% or sth like that when Israel changed policies. Israel itself also started to build settlements in Area C. Here are also 2 different types, once that are build where nothing was before, and others that are build on Palestinian land. Both are build in good locations, for example, in Jordan Valley are many settlements focusing on agriculture. The ones which are build on Palestinian land are pretty much the only ones that have a chance to get demolished, however this happens quite rarely. Recently there were even Palestinians that were forced to sell their land on which an illegal settlement was build. But these settlements being in good locations isn\'t the only issue. They need security, which is the Israeli military. This obviously also means that Palestinians aren\'t allowed to get too close to it, which causes the closure of nearby roads. For example, a road between 2 villages may get closed, forcing Palestinians to drive around it to arrive at their target. Lastly, there are also many important roads that go over long distances through West Bank. These roads are Israeli only, and Palestinians may only be allowed to drive through them with a special permit. A strong economy requires good ways to travel, due to this policy the economy in West Bank has serious issues. Area B is jointly controlled by Israel and PA. Area A is controlled by PA. However, Israel is the one collecting taxes, so they can put huge pressure on PA. Israel is also known to let PA pay extorbitant punishment fees for certain events. (Which they will take from the taxes themselves) They also regularily withhold taxes, for example they withheld the taxes when PA tried for its statehood to be recognized internationally. I\'m not too knowledgeable about Gaza either, so I won\'t talk about it so that I won\'t mention any mistakes. Coninued below...',
			'Now then this is the current situation. As for peace talks, I\'ll talk about this now: Don\'t trust the media. This is the most important point here sadly. There weren\'t "many opportunities Palestinians missed" like some people may proclaim. In fact, as far as I know, there were only a few times where they were moving well towards peace. The first time was probably during the creationg of the Oslo Accords. The ones that are often proclaimed as a failure, which they are. However, they\'re a failure because they\'re permanent. They were meant as a temporary measure to slowly give power to Palestinians and end in the creation of a Palestinian state. Sadly, the talks ended after the Israeli side was assassinated by an Israeli ultranationalist. The second time was Camp David and Taba Summit. Camp David failed because of a failure in basics of negotiations by Israel and the US. Israel really wanted peace and they blindly concentrated on this peace process, ignoring everything else. This included violating several agreements that they had with Palestinians. Palestinans obviously weren\'t happy with that and Israel wasn\'t able to get the message that they wanted peace to them. Instead Palestinians though that these peace talks would be a trap. They went to the US side and expressed their doubt and finally agreed to peace talks after getting a few agreements first. One of them was that there won\'t be any finger pointing. However, they only agreed to go to the talks, the trust issues still existed against both Israel and the US. Thinking it was a trap they didn\'t agree to anything and got their trust issues confirmed after the president that just promised them no finger pointing instantly started finger pointing. Yet this failure is still being blamed on the Palestinians in the media, which is why I said to not trust the media. Taba Summit was pretty much the continuation of Camp David. They were really close to an agreement there, and many main points were pretty much finished already. However, time ran out and there was a leadership change in Israel. The talks ended then. (Peace talks between Israel and Syria, which ended in failure, Camp David and the intifada cost too much time, thus these talks started way too late) Lastly were the Olmert talks and I\'ll be hones here, I\'m not too sure what to think about them either. Olmert was at the end of his career and people asked for him to resign (what he did shortly after the talks). Thus his political position was unstable and Palestinians had trust issues on whether the new leadership will follow the agreement. Officials on the US/Israel side also recommended the Palestinians to wait for a leader change in Israel and the US and not sign anything now. All of these probably contributed to why Palestinians didn\'t sign this agreement. This may have been a missed opportunity by Palestinians. Another important point is that peace talks currently are impossible. Recent peace talks had been between Fatah and Israel, as Hamas doesn\'t believe in peace talks. However, Israel has set requirements for peace talks that pretty much ask for the surrender of Hamas for there to be peace talks. Since this will never happen it means that unless Israel changes their requirements that there will be no peace talks. Fatah themselves also appear to not want direct talks with Israel as their past experiences showed that they\'ll just be painted black even if it\'s not their fault and because they don\'t believe Israel truly wants peace. It\'s also quite obvious that both the Palestinian and the Israeli leadership gain from the conflict. What else can give you support as easy as showing your citizen an enemy infront of them? The Palestinians fear that all their land will get stolen by Israelis, while the Israelis fear that they\'ll get murdered by Palestinians. On another note, if there is a serious peace process in the future, then without a doubt the biggest issue (other than trust) that it\'ll face are all those Israeli settlements in West Bank. There are many of them and many of them are in good land. So not only would Israel be unable to keep all of them (because a Palestinian state can\'t be completly fragmented, it would be impossible to manage), they would also have to exchange those that they do want to keep with land of equal value, which would be very difficult. Not to mention that the definition of the territory is different for each side. Israel says Israel annexed part of it in a war, while Palestinians say that it\'s still theirs, resulting in disputed territory. This is especially complicated for Palestinians because they think of Israel as already a compromise on the territory side. "They took already more than half of our land and now they want even more?" And while we\'re talking about territory, another reason that Palestinians aren\'t into direct talks with Israel currently is that they think Israel is only biding their time. They think Israel is continuing to increase settlement expansion to increase their leverage in a possible future peace agreement and to annex more land of West Bank. This obviously creates trust issues in whether Israel is truly looking for peace. This is why Fatah also appears to try to go use international processes to get to a peace agreement. Israel on the other hand is trying to stop that from happening. (An example of how they try to stop it would be how they withheld taxes when Palestine applied for statehood, as this was part of the process) They\'re currently trying to go through France, but I\'m also not too well informed in this, so I won\'t go into any details. Then there are terror attacks. They can be pretty much split into 2 groups: Organized and Lone wolf. Organized are attacks by Hamas and other terror groups that are operating in West Bank and Gaza. They are for example attacks via tunnels from Gaza (although, as far as I know, all of the recent ones were stopped before they happened), murder of Jews (like what the recent Gaza war triggered) and car bombings. The lone wolf attacks happen a lot in West Bank against Israeli settler. There are also terror attacks by Israelis, though those are way lower in number. The attacks by Israelis are often against property by settler in West Bank, like the burning down of a Palestinian orchard. TL;DR: It\'s fucked up. I hope I covered everything and didn\'t forget anything.',

Say this was poland, and there was a jewish camp, and the germans occupying poland refused to grant the jewish camp permits to build schools for their children. Say the EU funded the construction of schools for the children anyway, including, for instance, solar panels for the schools, because the destruction of poland has left this area without access to the power grid and the occupying germans have prevented them from building electrical infrastructure to connect to the grid. Then the german military comes in, destroys the schools for the jewish kids. Steals the solar panels.

Try reading the Zionist reaction to this proposed Palestinian state, including this part:  On 27 February 1939, in response to enthusiastic Arab demonstrations following reports that the British were proposing to allow Palestine independence on the same terms as Iraq, a coordinated Irgun bombing campaign across the country killed 38 Arabs and wounded 44.

			'I honestly don\'t believe that there will be any kind of compromise or two state solution. Even from the start the majority of Palestinians were in favor of some kind of reasonable compromise once they realized there was nothing they could do to stop what was happening and that the massacres/forced relocations and village destruction wasn\'t going to stop. Even now they have offered to agree to terms that overwhelmingly favor Israel. That said there was/is hardliners who refuse any solution except total Israeli withdrawal and do so with violence. But considering the subhuman treatment and war crimes steadily committed it\'s no surprise. I can\'t help but draw parallels with manifest destiny and the native Americans. In the sense that a population arrived with Devine authority who placed the natives on tiny parcels of land with next to no method of sustaining themselves. All the while deamonizing them and putting the blame squarely on them by holding up examples of attacks and terrorism that were generally feeble attempts at self defense or out of desperation due to starvation. And as in the case of Israel/Palestine the native Americans were hopelessly outnumbered and outgunned never standing a real chance resulting in massacres which they ended up blamed for. The future outcome of which being what Israel is most likely enacting now. Just wait them out, keep building and maintaining the party line that they have been fair and generous and are willing to come to a solution but these subhuman terrorists won\'t have it and would kill them all given the chance. Justifying total subjugation in the name of self defense, and in 50-100 years there would be no possible way to find a solution as is the case in north America. We will look back and say it was wrong and handled differently but the results remain the same the invading culture is so deeply engrained and the native one now entirely dependent on it. now a few generations down they are just desperately trying to hang on to their cultural identity. Nevermind their own autonomously functional state. Israel will likely do the same, just keep finding ways to kill time and not allow Palestine the ability or chance to gain any ability of an effective response or allow global opinion to be at all sympathetic to Palestine or at best conflicted on the matter. At the same time provoking them into violence out of desperation so they can be held responsible for the situation. Until the day comes where it\'s all to far gone and we\'ll be looking back with 20/20 hindsight seeing it for what it was but saying its horrible but there\'s nothing to be done now. It\'s sickening the horrible human rights abuses and war crimes Israel has done internally and to the entire region while exploiting the dead of the Holocaust not only for justifying atrocities as self defense but as a means of denying any semblance of real debate or criticism. If it were any other state/group behaving in such a manner and the victims weren\'t Muslim the global community would be responding with intervention and war crimes charges as it did with the African civil wars and ethnic cleansings of the 80s and 90s.',

The DPRK\'s political system is also politicized to the point of caricature in most Western media, so defining who is what can be messy based on how things actually work. Kim Yong-nam is the current elected president of the Presidium of the People\'s Assembly. When the legislative body is out of session there is an elected grouping of people called the Presidium who are granted smaller amounts of power (compared to the Assembly) to run the state on a day-to-day basis. Kim Jong-un is the current elected leader of the majority political party (Worker\'s Party) within the People\'s Assembly. He also holds a ton of political responsibilities and of course has a fair amount of celebrity/face status within the country. Really both of them could be a head of state.

North Korean and Chinese government posts and titles are complicated and frequently overlap. I suspect that in avoiding clearly delineating positions and roles, it avoids factionalism and prevents people from taking sides and/or rebelling - because the people inside are just as confused as the people on the outside.  A more useful title for the likes of Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping would be "paramount leader" as it more accurately describes their position and role in their respective communist governments. Among the more important titles that a paramount leader must hold include:  Leadership of their respective communist parties Leadership of the country\'s military, and which more often than not swears loyalty to the party instead of the nation  Head of state or president, and head of government or premier is not necessary.

Weirdly, a lot of the bad stuff you read about in Iran are actually symptoms of change for good; the bad guys are trying desperately to cling to power, but it\'s slipping away. Either there will be a massive crack-down, or Iran will slowly, slowly return to modernity. The way things are looking right now, the government is actually mostly pro-change; the trouble are the old guard, the majlis and the Ayatollah (similar to the Supreme Court, but just one guy).

			'It is theorized that the early Israelities borrowed the "Dualist" concepts of light vs dark, good vs evil found in Zorastrionism. As well as life after death in fact. But it wasnt the only religion they borrowed from. The concept of the great flood, creation, and tower of Babel probably originate from Jews living in exile in Babylonia. The concept of the Hebrew God YAWH may have originally been a Cannanite god (god of mountains & thunder) one who\'s consort is still referenced in the Hebrew Bible to this day (polytheistic origin!) The Israelite religion is ancient indeed, changed over time, and borrowed concepts and evolved through contact with a number of other religious traditions.',
			'Actually it is not quite clear when exactly Zoroastrianism came into existence, time frames range from 1800 to 600 BC making it emerge somewhere before/after/at the same time as Judaism. For one it is clear that there were certain concepts being transferred form Zoroastrianism to Judaism like the concept of the end of the world for example.  Other concepts that emerged out of Zoroastrianism are for example the idea of heaven and hell, monotheism, as well as the struggle between good and evil in the forms of a god versus some kind of devil. Either way most of this information is so old that it is hard to find a clear answer to the who came first debate.',

			'That\'s only if you take "Judaism" to include even vaguely related forms of Semitic Polytheism in which Yahweh was a lesser god. By 1200 BC, the chief god was El, not Yahweh. The prominence of Yahweh only started after 900 BC, and after that it took several more centuries for other cults, such as those of Baal and El, to disappear. Of course, after that Judaism went through several rounds of sweeping reforms; the Jews as we know them today, particularly the Ashkenazim, have very little to do - genetically and culturally - with the proto-Jews of the 6th century BC.',

Shapur II massacred a bunch of Christians for 40 years in his empire after Constantine adopted Christianity as the state religion of Rome whilst other Sassanian rulers tolerated Christians who fled Byzantine persecutions. Source: http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/christianity-i The reason why people don\'t persecute as much today has mostly to do with secularism. Would a Sassanid Iran eventually adopt secularism? There\'s no reason to think so. Secularism developed in the West as an ideology because of specific important events which are unique to it.  by the time the Safavids reunited Iran it had lapsed into tribalism  What are you talking about? Most of Iran was united under different dynasties during the Islamic era. At first it was under Arab empires and then the capital of the next empires shifted to being centered in Iran whilst led by Persianized Turkics. This happened until the Mongol invasion which was the most destructive event Iran faced where it\'s estimated that Iran\'s population wouldn\'t recover in number until the early 20th century. Then there were the Persianized Mongol empires (Ilkhanate and Timurids) that had all of Iran under control. Some dynasties which took small parts of Iran popped up between the transitions but they didn\'t last long (about three to five decades at most). The Safavid weren\'t the first to united Iran after the fall of the Sassanids. Iran was united under different factions and the Safavids were some of the latest ones to re-unite it following the fall of the Timurids.',

Nevermind the fact that Iran\'s most prolific thinkers and poets came several hundred years after Iran became majority Muslim, and that Iranian culture and Sassanian bureacracy remained well-intact as the Arabs had no previous exposure to governing huge tracts of land such as the new Caliphate and relied on the Iranians to do so.',
			'Why go so far back? Just wish the West had left Iran alone in the 50s onwards and we would likely have a pretty chill Iran as well.',

			'Fun facts about Zoroastrianism:  It’s possibly the oldest religion in the world if we assume the earlier birthdate of Zoroaster (2000 BC). Freddy Mercury was Zoroastrian. Zoroastrian priests are called Magi. The Three Wise Men at the Nativity were Magi. It’s also where we get the word “magic”. Zoroastrians practice “sky burials” where the corpse is left out for vultures. This practice is not exclusive to Zoroastrians. Many steppe tribes practiced it or still do. The Persians were originally a steppe tribe and didn’t convert to Zoroastrianism until about the 6th Century BC when they occupied Iran. Despite being Iranian in origin, the vast majority of Zoroastrians live in India now because the religion was banned under Islamic rule for most of Iran’s history. It is however legal to be born Zoroastrian today in Iran, but converting to it from Islam is a no no. Despite what you’ve read, Zoroastrianism is not a monotheistic religion. It is “duotheistic” because it believes in 2 gods: a good and evil one of equal power. Certain extinct sects of Zoroastrianism also worship more than one good god. This is the inspiration for The Red God vs. the Great Other in Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones). Zoroastrians worship “the purity of fire” and their temples all contained an eternal flame. This is where that concept originates. ',
			'I was so sure this was r/crusaderkings. Just goes to show that life is weird.',
			'if you\'re anything like me: Zoroastrianism,[n 1] or more natively Mazdayasna, is one of the world\'s oldest extant religions, "combining a cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism in a manner unique [...] among the major religions of the world".[1] Ascribed to the teachings of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra),[2] it exalts a deity of wisdom, Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord), as its Supreme Being.[3] Major features of Zoroastrianism, such as messianism, heaven and hell, and free will have, some believe, influenced other religious systems, including Second Temple Judaism, Gnosticism, Christianity, and Islam.[4]',

			'Thanks thats very informative!',
			'What\'s your opinion on the pre-harvest burns of sugar cane fields in Florida? I was told the damage was a lot less because they just quickly scorch the weeds and pests out.',
			'Topsoil is required for land based agriculture. Topsoil is made from carbon, the decayed organic matter from plants. Burning, releases all the carbon form the biomass into the atmosphere (CO2 leading to other problems) and prevents the production of new topsoil. It also exposes any current topsoil to the sun wind and rain, causing it to erode into the waterways, leading aquatic dead zones, contributing to dying reefs, and murky waters that prevent photosynthesis of the aquatic plants, etc.  They have pests and weeds because they are farming with the monoculture method, one species, and a lot of one species. This literally generates the perfect conditions for pests, weeds, and disease. If you want to reduce weeds and remove pests you need biodiversity. \'Weeds\' are pioneer plants, specifically designed to quickly remediate damaged soil, so every time they burn, and leave soil exposed they are inviting the weeds back in. My opinion is that monoculture, and off contour plowing is more destructive than all wars combined, and is the root cause of the civilization existing in a state of scarcity instead of abundance. If you want to know more I have written up 20 or so pages here explaining it in more depth. It explains the cause and effects as well as the alternative solutions that leads to abundance, clear oceans, and potable rivers and lakes.',

			'I will try, but to put it into context, you are asking me to describe the diffeference of having 30 unique school children in a classroom vs 30 clones of the same child, I am sure you can imagine there is a lot to this topic.  1: Pests vs balance, if you plant thousands of hectares of wheat (grass) you create your own problem of grasshoppers. Then you have to use pesticides (adding cost, and poison). A field of wheat has no trees, adding trees provides habitat for birds, that eat the grasshoppers.  If you only grow tomatoes, you get tomato hornworms. If you plant tomatoes with other species that produce nectar, you attract (employ) yellow jacket wasps. YJ wasps are vegetarians as adults, and require sugar to fuel their bodies while hunting. The wasps will hunt the worms and bring them back to their nest to feed to the baby wasps so they have the protein to grow into adult wasps. This is an example of utilizing nature to contribute to human food production.  2: Layered growing/stacking functions. Example,  Canopy layer (apple, plum, cherry) Shrubs (Berry bushes) Herbacious layer (tomatoes, lettuce, etc) Ground cover (Clover, strawberry, etc)  Root crop (potato, carrot, etc)  Here you are stacking for space.  3: Nutrients; Legumes species (plants with seed pods), like clover, peanuts, peas, beans, and trees like the Acacia all have a \'super ability\' where they work symbiotically with bacteria to extract atmospheric nitrogen into a plant available nitrogen. Essentially, free fertilizer. Mixing these species in with your productive crops reduces or removes the need to add nitrogen fertilizer, which is made from fossil fuels.  Other cover crops are known for (I have yet to see the scientific data for this aspect though) where their roots are specialized for extracting trace minerals from the soil. These minerals become part of the leaves, which die, rot, and become available for your apple tree. A plant famous for this is Comfrey (and sunflower). 4: Subsoil; Mixing species is only scratching the surface, another large topic is what goes on below the soil. A well designed system will have a fungal network that connect all the plants together just like our internet. The mushrooms use acid to dissolve the regolith (subsoil, below the topsoil) to release trace minerals and exchange them with the plants roots, the plant in return share carbohydrates (sugars) with the mushroom, because the mushroom can not produce sugar on their own. There are a wide range of benefits, the more biodiversity you have, the less human work is required to \'maintain it\'. A forest requires no (but preferably a little) maintenance. I build edible food forests, here is a > link < to one of them. This one is urban, I have yet the opportunity to build a rural farm sized example, but I am associated with people who do.  I am more scared of monoculture farming than I am of nuclear war one hundred times over. Monoculture farming is by far the biggest threat to all life on earth.

In fact, one of the deltas in Mexico where the Colorado River drains into the Pacific actually doesn\'t even reach the ocean anymore. It stops before the ocean in a newly formed swamp area.

			'Japan did not know that the Soviets were going to attack until the evening of August 8th. They had a non-aggression pact with the Soviets; the latter had withdrawn from it, but the terms of the pact still held them to no aggressive action for 1 year after its dissolution, and it still had several months left on that period. (Thus the Soviets broke their treaty to go to war with Japan, something the rest of the world didn\'t much mind...) The US had known through its radio intercepts and decryption that the civilian Japanese government had discussed talking about peace with the Soviets with their ambassador in Moscow, Sato. Sato wasn\'t able to make any progress because the Soviets didn\'t want to talk about anything but particular terms, while the Japanese didn\'t want to discuss specifics to begin with, not least of which because they didn\'t have agreement internally regarding what terms they would even offer. Sato came out and said as much, basically "if you want me to talk with the Soviets about ending the war, first you\'ve got to decide to end the war!" The US leadership also had a lot of other contemporary evidence talking about Japan getting ready for last-ditch resistance, but due to how things got declassified, the diplomatic intercepts were released way before the military ones, and by themselves they give an incomplete picture.',

The Russians were of course planning their own invasion, but strung them along, and the United States would hear absolutely nothing of negotiated peace anyway. Both the United States and Russia were looking ahead to the Cold War at this point, and racing to get to Japan first so they could secure key strategic positions in the Pacific.',

They had few ways to even get to the islands and if they did, they would need to hope to be able to take a port before running out of supply. The Soviets simply did not have the logistical ability or experience to perform a feat on par with operation Overlord or the proposed operations Olympic or Coronet (Downfall). The primary threat the Soviets posed was the removal of Manchurian and Korean food supply, but it wasn\'t like the US had been doing a bad job at that, considering they sank 80% of Imperial Japan\'s merchant capacity by wars end.

			'Island hopping was necessary to choke off the islands from their supply chains, as Japan simply did not have the resources to prosecute war natively, and to gain the strategic foothold to launch air raids. Honestly, the invasion of the home islands would likely have never been neccessary. The Allies could have accepted conditional surrender, they could have waited for Russia to launch their invasion, they could simply waited, though only the first option is guaranteed to limit Japanese civilian casualties.  In any case, had a land invasion taken place, the overrall casualty statistics would likely not have been as high as reported, as the five hundred thousand to one million reports were largely generated after Japan had already surrendered. Initial navy estimates were much lower....I mean, there still would have been casualties in the tens of thousands, and lord knows how many japanese deaths, including civilian, but it would not have cost us 500,000 or more lives.',
			'"The Allies could have accepted conditional surrender," That would have been hard because Japan never offered their surrender. You can always what if and guess what else could would have happened but based on our experiences taking the islands and based on their preparations no they were not on the verge of surrendering. As for Russia invading, regardless of which ally did the invading it was still going to cause large numbers of casualties on both sides.  As for casualty estimates, all serious estimates including the low ball ones are far higher than the ones due to the bombs.  Thanks for showing that there is no serious argument against using the bombs. ',
			'ockquote> There is also stories that Japan was telling the US through other countries that they wanted to discuss an end to the war.   Why would the US trust Japan after Japan was caught trying to claim it didn\'t seek hostilities, via telegram, while Pearl Harbor was being bombed?

The idea that tens of thousands of people might be killed suddenly was not some kind of new element in the war; it was a milestone that had already been surpassed. Why would the US balk at doing so in August if it had been happy with doing so in March?  In fact, the US was going to continue dropping atomic bombs as soon as they were ready. They were going to use it as a prelude to the invasion that was less than 100 days away. Because, as you said, it was just a part of warfare then. That we think of it as horrific today doesn\'t remove the context for the decision making to drop those bombs back then. Likewise, at the end of the day, POTUS was accountable to the American people first and foremost. If the US had a weapon in its arsenal that could have reduced tens of thousands of American deaths and chose not to use it - he would have been hung, and rightfully so.',

So the plan is probably a combination of smaller cleaner nukes and matching delivery systems that are more tactical than strategic, but that\'s just a guess. ',
			'I think it\'s just a continuation of the trend in US nuclear weapons that\'s been going for some time. Apparently the background research leading to this decision began during Obama\'s administration, and a lot of it has to do with how good our guidance systems are. The US fields smaller warheads than Russia does for a simple reason: we know our guidance systems are accurate enough that we will destroy our targets with warheads this size. Russia knows their guidance systems are less accurate, and so they need more powerful warheads to ensure that enough destruction is caused within the blast radius to ensure their targets are destroyed. With that in mind, we may have determined that we can make another step in this direction to yet smaller warheads, because our sense of how accurately we can target them has stepped up to match it. This also lets us do more interesting things with our reentry vehicles and missiles, because smaller warheads will be lighter and therefore will require less fuel to perform the same mission. That extra margin can be used for maneuvering to avoid countermeasures like anti-missile systems. edit: I\'ll flesh this out a little more. When you get down to it, MAD isn\'t about ensuring the death of your aggressor\'s population. It\'s a means to ensure they have no government and military to take advantage of the loss of your government and military.  In this sense, MAD would still work if the world had no nuclear weapons, but instead had satellites with high-powered lasers that could track and fire on 100% of a country\'s government officials and the members of their military even through solid rock; instead of blasting cities with intense, indiscriminate bursts of radiation, these satellite arrays would make all tracked individuals\' heads explode. The military theory behind such a weapons system would be almost indistinguishable from what we have today. ',

			'The development of our new nuclear posture is largely in response to shifting Russian nuclear posture. The Russian nuclear doctrine has come to assume that NATO nations will be loathe use a nuclear weapon under any circumstance. Their war doctrine in general is coming to rely increasingly on small scale tactical nuclear strikes as a first move when dealing with any peer or near peer power. The frequently wargame scenarios in which they push west into Europe by using small nuclear weapons against important infrastructure and military targets to negate their disadvantage in conventional arms. They believe that due to our general posture of absolute reticence in nuclear weapon use they can subvert the conventional assumptions of MAD. The idea is that if they open with a quick land grab backed by limited small yield nuclear strikes they can force us to come to the table and accept an unfavorable peace. Western nuclear arsenals (the U.S. in particular) are designed with the cold war mind set of mass exchanges in mind. This limits our retaliatory options to only those which are likely to spark further escalation, something they (correctly I believe) assume we won\'t do. By developing newer small yield, tactical use, nuclear weapons we even the playing field back out by giving our self retaliatory options that are in parity with the attacks we are likely to suffer. This forces Russia to accept the idea of a potential conflict of micro nuclear exchanges backed by conventional weapons use, once again putting them at a disadvantage and removing the incentive for them to use any sort of nuclear weapon in the first place. Essentially while it appears inflammatory these developments are designed to reinforce the status quo. This is one article that has some interesting thoughts on the modern nuclear balance between NATO and Russia; https://www.frstrategie.org/publications/notes/russia-s-evolving-nuclear-doctrine-and-its-implications-2016-01 The following two paragraphs are key I think;  Less well understood but possibly of greater relevance, however, is Russia’s interest in and development of capabilities for more limited nuclear use. Moscow is aware of its only partial success in fielding a modern conventional military and of that force’s imperfect ability to challenge the forces of the United States and NATO in a broader conflict as well as of the relatively narrow relevance of its strategic nuclear forces in situations short of the apocalyptic. This leaves a significant gap in Russia’s defense posture: left alone, Russia’s conventional forces could be decisively overcome by NATO forces in a plausible conflict over, for instance, the Baltics or other countries in Eastern Europe. Such a scenario would likely fall considerably short of a situation in which Moscow would see the utility in initiating a general nuclear strike against NATO, a strike that would essentially inevitably result in a comparable massive Western response. Russia could therefore find itself exposed to Western coercion if this vulnerability were left unaddressed . To deal with this problem, Russia has for a number of years seen the value of seeking to extend credible nuclear deterrence down the ladder of escalation to scenarios below the extreme in order to deter the West from seeking to exploit this potential conventional vulnerability as leverage. As Russian expert Yuri Federov has outlined, “[I]n the strategic environment since the end of the Cold War, instead of massive use of nuclear weapons planned by the Soviets during the Cold War, [the] Russian military command [has] sought to develop a method of limited use of nuclear weapons that will enable them to deter or stop [an] attack of superior conventional forces without escalation into total nuclear exchange or large-scale regional war.” .Moscow has occasionally described the objective of such nuclear employment as “de-escalation of aggression,” an approach sometimes termed an “escalate to de-escalate” strategy.” . An influential 2003 official document, for instance, described “[d]e-escalation of aggression” as the effort to “forc[e] the enemy to halt military action by a threat to deliver or by actual delivery of strikes of varying intensity with reliance on conventional and (or) nuclear weapons.” .Russia appears to see both nuclear weapons of tailored effect and non-nuclear but “strategic” conventional weapons as being of potential use in such scenarios . This strategy is consistent with those of other countries facing a potential adversary possessing stronger conventional forces – NATO in the Cold War and Pakistan vis-à-vis India, for instance . In accord with this doctrine, Moscow has since the early 1990s made clear that it would resort to using nuclear weapons first.  While Moscow generally paints this as defensive in nature their posturing and wargaming indicate that they consider the offensive potential of it as well.',
			'Nice response. I would just add that our nuclear arsenal modernization has not changed much under this “new” nuclear posture review. The B-61 bomb is already nearing the end of its life extension program.

			'I\'m just going to drop these numbers here if this is going to be debated: Based on the extremely bloody assault of Iwo Jima and other Pacific islands, the US military estimated the casualties for a campaign of invading the Japanese home islands would be 1.7 - 4 million American soldiers, and 5 - 10 million Japanese including civilians. To put this in perspective, the amount of Japanese that died as a result of the atomic bombs was somewhere between 129,000 - 226,000. The Japanese civilians were completely indoctrinated by the emperor system and were literally being given spears, young children included, and ordered to fight the Americans to the death in suicide attacks in the event of an invasion. After several years of trying to formulate an opinion on this, I have to say that the atomic bombs were certainly the lesser of evils, at least numerically, and especially when accounting for the would be continuation of the massive genocide in China and across the Pacific islands. And to put that genocide in perspective, the high estimate is 10 million, 4 million more than the holocaust.

			'The part that most people miss is that the atomic bombs weren\'t effective because of destruction. Japan killed more of their own civilians on Okinawa than the US did with either bomb. The Japanese strategy at that point in the way was to force the US to accept a negotiated surrender through attrition. Tojo advocated a literal fight to the last man, but Hirohito believed the US would give up if Japan lost roughly half its populace while causing proportional casualties. The atomic bomb opened the gates to devastating losses with no chance of retaliation. The US never had to set foot on the home islands to wipe out every population center. The Japanese quickly changed their math for what a continued war would look like and surrendered. I highly recommend The Fleet at Flood Tide as a pretty balanced look at the late stages of the war in the Pacific.',
			'That\'s fine. Two did the job. We don\'t need 4000. ',
			'I\'ll preface this with that I\'m not a fan of nukes being used. But main reason for high numbers is expecting to use them after a 1st strike. Where most of our capability would be destroyed already, plus the high numbers that have a high probability of being intercepted, plus duds since our safeties are designed to make it fail unless everything will go perfect. So at least 3/4 are expected useless. And with all that, need a stupid high number so that anyone that would initiate would have no false sense of possibility of survival. As truly evil as nukes are, they\'ve been the main reason we haven\'t seen an actual war since Korea between major powers. Historically, we have been due for a major powers conflict, nukes have prevented that. The greatest threat now is a rouge nation that\'s leadership just doesn\'t care, or a stolen one by an extremist group, but even Pakistan doesn\'t want that, who are the greatest risk at the moment. I hope another nuke is never denigrated in anger, and unfortunately other nukes are the most assured method for now. The genie is out, and can never go away.',
			'US has 8000 already. ',
			'6,800 of which 1,800 are deployed. But it would take much less than that to wipe out human civilization.',
			'There is a compelling school of thought that it was Russia invading Manchuria (which was under Japanese control at the time) was the real cause for the surrender. And even that Truman had asked Stalin not to invade Japan in order to buy more time for developing the bombs so they could be used on the world stage. We had completely destroyed many cites by that point in the war. It doesn\'t seem to make much difference whether it\'s done by hundreds of planes dropping thousands of bombs or one plane and one bomb. ',
			'the soviet invasion of Manchuria is soooo overrated as a cause for surrender. By this point in the war, Japanese troops in Manchuria and in japan were compleltely cut off from each other thanks to American mining of the waters around japan. Not to mention the fact that the soviets had no navy with which to escort nor invade the home islands. Read the book Downfall if you want an actual good view of what caused japan to surrender',
			'Its wasn\'t the invasion it was the DOW Japan wanted Soviets to mediate a conditional surrender and Soviet DOW ended that possibility. ',
			'I don\'t think this holds much water. The nuclear panic in the late 40s and early 50 was huge, everyone thought conventional warfare was over and from here on out every single war with a nuclear capable nation would just be won by dropping nukes on your enemy until they surrender. The Russians scrambled to get their own nuke built as quickly as possible because they thought it was inevitable that the US would bomb them and more or less take over the world. The US army actually field tested a nuclear cannon because they thought the army would be dissolved if it didn\'t have nuclear capabilities. In WW2 a lot of countries tried to make entire cities go away by bombing them, and none of those attempts really worked all that well. When nukes came around people thought they had finally found the weapon that can do it in a single hit. That was a big deal. A single nuke on a V2 would have turned the Blitz from a spiteful terror into an effective attack. People knew that that was profound. ',
			'Huh so compelling school of thought is apparently a synonym for fringe beliefs by quacks.',
			'It seems to have a lot greater traction than you give it credit for. America ending the war with the atom bomb is obviously a more palatable for American audiences at the time. Seems propagandaish to an extent. Maybe it\'s a combination of the bomb and the Japanese realizing that a two front war would decimate them. I\'ll freely admit I\'m know history expert ',
			'the problem is that the Soviet far east navy was completely incapable of actually carrying out an amphibious assault with more than a battalion of troops, thus the Soviets were not a real threat on the Japanese mainland.',

And even when the moderates prevented the coup, we had to bluff like we had more atomic bombs ready to drop.',
			'From Wikipedia: "After 2007 however, some began to believe that Telesur appeared to be a propaganda tool for Hugo Chávez and his Bolivarian Revolution, with the network being described as "a mouthpiece for Chávez".[65][66][67][3] According to Aram Aharonian, the founder of Telesur, Chávez "took the reins" of Telesur and used "propaganda as rolling news", with Aharonian being removed from Telesur in December 2008 by former Venezuelan Minister of Popular Power for Communication and Information Andres Izarra.[3] " I\'m Venezuelan. I lived through the creation of Telesur mostly funded with Venezuelan oil money back in the day.

			'Government institutions are the biggest and most loyalty-based hierarchical systems in society. Mafia might be more strictly enforced but they are rather small and uninfluential. Companies can never be that tightly-knit. Police forces are also based on loyalty, which is easily observable in the police shooting cases. Then you also have a network for allied countries who pledge allegiance to the hierarchical power between big and small nations. Loyalty is the single most important programmable human conditions that affect human interactions and the respective social networks statistically. It has caused the rise and fall of all the civilizations in history. A lot of interesting aspects of the world can be found if you ponder about correlations and causality between related systems in reality. I think it might have to do with the sexual reproduction involving two genders statistically programming animals into herd-like groups for survival, which just eventually evolve from tribes to civilizations.',
			'Estimates of an invasion of mainland Japan range from 1.5 million to 4 million American Troops and 5-10 million Japanese lives (civilian and military). Such a loss would be unacceptable for both USA and Japan. Dropping the bombs, while extremely tragic, was the only way to prevent further destruction on mainland Japan.  It should be noted that America sustained less than 500,000 losses throughout the course of WW2. ',

Now he seems to entrust his military more autonomy, so I don\'t think his rashness necessarily spills into that arena, but he is rash. Kim can be described with a litany of bad adjectives, but rash is not one of them. The guy is very calculating, in the worst sort of way.',

You stated that the US military seems clear of rash decisions by the POTUS due to autonomy. Based on that, how could one be any more concerned about the POTUS than they are of the suprememe leader?',

Also I can imagine the GOP coming out with "In such times of crisis we cannot afford distractions like this Mueller investigation...". He, personally, would never be at risk and it could provide considerable advantages to him.',

There\'s plenty of decent people saying Trump\'s an unstable moron, we don\'t need to elevate murderous dictator\'s comments to that effect.

This is hardly a new fight, the only thing that\'s bought it to the fore is the imminence of a final outcome. There are some Brexiteers who would happily trade anything just to be free of the EU. It\'s become a source of fanatical zeal now. These zealots don\'t see this as a sinking ship at all, but some liberation into a free trading global economy which will ultimately begin to replicate an economic model like Malaysia\'s. It was one of the great ironies that the lower income Brexit voters will be amongst the biggest casualties as they lose a lot of their rights  The parliamentary conservative party has a remain majority (which is odd) even if the membership is pro-Brexit. Theresa May might find that she\'s unable to balance the two factions sometime during this year and is ultimately forced into sacking Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Liam Fox. As things stand, she could probably beat any of them in a leadership challenge (certainly at Westminster anyway) but the problem emerges in the run-off. 58% of conservative voters, voted for Brexit (Ashcroft polling) party members are likely to be more fundamentalist I\'d have thought, but we don\'t really know. She\'ll benefit a little bit for loyalty, but there will also be those looking at 2022 and the spectre of Prime Minister Corbyn, who will reckon that Boris Johnson represents their best bet of preventing him . It also seems inconceivable that she can lead the Tories into 2022, so it really is a question of when rather than if',

They\'d probably scream it regardless. No matter the outcome. Even if Brexit was an astounding success, they\'d say that the Jews Globalists sabotaged their country for decades up to that point anyway.',
			'It\'s not odd given they\'re meant to be the party of the establishment (whose experts were ~90% against brexit) and of conservatism, an ideology which espouses gradual and considered change.
