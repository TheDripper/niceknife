			'And isn\'t this right after they were cleared of investigation or something? How convenient.',

			'No need to wonder. In America, we’ve legalized the bribery and it’s all right out in the open. Equifax donated $54,000 to Republican candidates during the 2016 election.  Buying politicians is the best investment you can make in America. I encourage anyone who is unhappy with the current system donate to [Wolf PAC ](www.wolf-pac.com) , who are fighting to force a constitutional convention to end all private political donations and publicly fund elections. It can be done without Congress if enough state legislatures vote for it, and several states already have. Edit 1: fixed a broken link Edit 2: I’d like to add to what I said above, to give some hope to those reading this who are justifiably pessimistic at the state of politics in America, which has been so broken and corrupt for so long. We don’t need every state to call for a convention to force one to happen, only two thirds of them. So far, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington State have all approved the measure. Wolf PAC has only been working for seven years or so now, and they’ve made quite a bit of progress for such a relatively small and under funded organization. The reason for that is two fold. First, an over whelming majority of Americans support removing money from politics, across party lines. It’s 93% if memory serves. Second, although politics is totally corrupted at the national level, at the state level it’s not nearly so far gone in many states. State representatives and senators often listen to their constituents, and actually change their opinions and their votes on an issue, especially when its on an issue so popular. And when they don’t, they can always be voted out. I can’t remember which state it was, but there’s already been one instance of a high ranking member of the state legislature killing the Wolf PAC bill to call for a convention. So Wolf PAC literally had someone buy a house in his district, move in, and coordinate a campaign against him on this one issue. He lost re-election, and the measure was then passed. I understand people feeling pessimistic, but on this issue I think it’s really inevitable for the Constitution to be amended to publicly finance elections. It’s only a question of how long it will take. ',

			'You are 100 percent correct. They stole everyone’s data to not make it look like intelligence gathering but I see some bribes in the near future. ',
			'E X T R A T H I C C ',

They\'re a data broker, used by law enforcement, insurance companies, private investigators, collections agencies, and more. Their entire purpose is to collect as much data as possible about everyone.  They don\'t just have your SSN and your email, they have every address you\'ve ever lived at and every phone you\'ve ever owned - including non-public numbers like cellphones. You have a concealed weapons permit? They know about it. They know what cars and properties you own, as well as who your insurance company, any claims you\'ve filed, and even your insurance policy number. Divorce records, criminal records, they have it all.  With access to LexusNexus you can literally type in a phone number and get the SSN of the person who owns it.

			'As a bank teller, I can confirm your bank actually should have all of that. Possibly not an email address, but as for everything else, your bank should have all of that. The Patriot Act covers almost all of that. ',

Edit: Here\'s some more: On January 18, 2018, Mulvaney requested that the CFPB receive no (zero) budgetary funding, and simultaneously moved to drop several high-profile lawsuits against predatory payday lenders, and dropped an investigation into a lender that contributed directly to Mulvaney\'s campaign.

Only one I get is car warranty and FCC is powerless (this was a few years ago...) to do anything, they had been investigating the company apparently they just don\'t give a fuck.

I got a recruiter the other day who thought it was me for 56 seconds. The recording cracked me up. Or you can be boring and tell it to simply block the calls. Works well though. I also hear good things about the app Hiya.',

They literally gave our information and provide us with a zero cost service. I feel sorry for the poor saps that actually agreed to that. Now they’re offering a free one time “dark web scans” to see if your name is out there. Spoiler alert — it’s out there and it likely came from them! The government needs to step in and Shut. It. Down. Equifax has zero credibility to be handling PII this day in age. Edit: they’re not their',

The process to have them removed was simple and didn\'t take very long. Equifax though? Hoo boy. There online review process was down for like 8 months and doing it over the phone was a complete joke. I still have two hits on there that were handled years ago that they keep telling me they\'ll take down... Months later they\'re still there. ',

They have lost all reason and won\'t even pay lip service to protecting Americans and our enforcing our laws when big money is on the table.

			'Gonna take this opportunity to copy pasta my favorite Pence post...  There\'s a difference between being a representative and being a governor.  As a representative, you push for your special interests.  As a governor, you do what\'s best for your state.  Pence got the endorsement from the much-liked former Republican governor Mitch Daniels (now president of Purdue) basically with the promise that he wouldn\'t pursue a social agenda. Mitch Daniels was liked because he focused almost exclusively on the economy and government efficiency. He gave no fucks about social issues, and it was implied that Pence, as the successor of Daniels, would set aside the social dogmas that he was known for and govern a state that was on a very good path, economically, after Mitch Daniels\' two terms. He didn\'t do that.  From day one, Pence didn\'t govern--he played national GOP politics. Whatever the big firey debate of the day was among the national GOP, he grabbed ahold of it and pretended to be its conservative crusader, even if it had absolutely zero relevance to the state of Indiana. He spent time, money, and resources on championing issues that Hoosiers didn\'t care about or didn\'t support, because he wanted to pander to the National GOP\'s ultra conservative base for his future career. Essentially, he was using Indiana as a stepping stone. He never cared about being governor. He always had higher aspirations, and the governorship was a stepping stone to a higher federal office. Most Hoosiers, left or right on the political spectrum, espouse this opinion about him. As I said before, Mitch Daniels literally gave no fucks about social issues. Indiana is generally a conservative state, but it\'s never been a state particularly hung up on social issues, and it\'s never been a state that follows the national GOP\'s social platform. Indiana has, for as long as I\'ve been alive, been a business Republican state--politicians like the Bushes, Mitt Romney, etc. We voted Obama into office, and prior to Mitch Daniels in 2005, we had 16 straight years of Democratic governorship. Indianapolis, the capital and largest city in the state, routinely switched between Republican and Democrat mayors, and it has managed to have long-term plans and continue its momentum regardless of which party is in office. So Pence, with his national conservative GOP politics, has been an aberration that has directly harmed Indiana\'s image and its pocket book.  In the three years since Pence took office, he:  Pushed through legislation making harsher penalties for drug crimes against the protests of numerous major legal organizations including the Indiana Bar Association, as well as most Hoosiers Inherited a phenomenal state balance sheet from Mitch Daniels and used it as an excuse to push tax cuts so extreme (would have caused a tremendous deficit) that the Republican-controlled Congress shut him down Tried and failed to amend the Indiana constitution to ban gay marriage, despite widespread polling that showed that Hoosiers didn\'t support it, and despite the vociferous condemnation of virtually every major business in the state Since his gay marriage amendment failed, he literally, as payback (not exaggerating, the signing ceremony was invite only, no media was allowed or invited, but someone leaked a picture that showed Pence surrounded by well-known anti-LGBT extremists), came back with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was a genuine political circus. It humiliated Indiana on the national stage, directly harmed Indianapolis, and was met with, perhaps, the fiercest backlash by the people of any state in the Union. The extraordinary protests of Hoosiers and businesses allowed the state GOP leaders to basically coerce--to his visible chagrin--Pence to amend the law and "fix it" (this was actually the front page of the biggest newspaper in Indiana).  The RFRA was such a debacle that Pence ended up hiring an expensive out-of-state public relations firm to heal Indiana\'s national image. He couldn\'t answer why he chose an out-of-state firm. He couldn\'t answer why he chose such an expensive firm, when there are many firms in Indiana that could have done the job. It was eventually canceled, and was yet another waste of taxpayer money. To date, the RFRA has cost Indianapolis (a city that fought against it, changed the official tourism website to rainbow colors, and hung a huge rainbow banner at the airport) $60 million, and the total cost--to the economy and reputation--to the rest of the state is unknown.  During the gay marriage supreme court fight, he literally sent the Indiana attorney general to other states to advise them on how to craft their laws and fight gay marriage nationally. He did this on the taxpayer dollar. He continued to spend taxpayer money fighting gay marriage in the courts and with lawsuits despite, at the time, everyone knowing what the Supreme Court decision was going to be. It was basically a political stand by Pence; an expensive political stand that Hoosiers didn\'t support. He fought to pass a law preventing cities from passing their own minimum wage statutes. Is this "small government"?  He has acted like a strongman (think Turkey\'s Erdoğan), doing everything in his power to make Glenda Ritz, the state superintendent and an elected official, quit her job, and barring that, stripping her of the power given to her by the Indiana constitute and the Hoosiers that elected her through backroom deals, conspiracy, and highly technical legal challenges. Just Google "Mike Pence Glenda Ritz." You could write a thesis on it.  Everyone, literally everyone, was on board for receiving a huge federal grant for preschool funding. The Indiana Department of Education was literally in the final stages of the application process--and the federal government was happy with Indiana and going to give us an especially large chunk of money--when Pence came in and shut it down for no reason because accepting money from the feds became politically untenable among the national GOP tea partier crowd. And, of course, you can\'t be elected president--Pence\'s eyes were always on the future--without support from the GOP\'s far right base. After shutting down the process, he has recently been opining that it would be a good idea to get federal money to fund preschools... A year after he shit all over the Dept of Education\'s proposal to do just that.  The HIV epidemic in southern Indiana is out of control and among the worst in the country. Of course, we could provide free needles for heroin addicts like has been done in many states to curb HIV problems, but that is politically repugnant to Mike Pence. He also managed to get the Planned Parenthoods in that part of the state shut down, eliminating the opportunity for poor people to get tested. The HIV epidemic, which never had to be an epidemic, continues, and Pence gets to push the problem on our future governor as he goes to join Trump on the national stage.  Speaking of Planned Parenthood, Pence is highly proud of his accomplishment at passing the single most restrictive abortion law since Roe vs Wade. The law, HEA 1337 is far stricter than anything even in the Deep South and is almost certainly unconstitutional. He knows that it\'s probably unconstitutional. Nevertheless, Indiana taxpayers will spend millions of dollars for our attorney general to fight the law all the way to the Supreme Court, just so Pence could make his political statement.  He literally tried to make a state-run news agency that he would then give exclusive interviews and access to. I don\'t even know if that\'s legal, but he tried to do it and was promptly crucified by the media and even his own party.  He asserted authority to ban Syrian refugees from being settled in Indiana. He has no authority. No governor has. He knew that, but he was planning to be a GOP presidential candidate, and he needed to show that he was strong and anti-Muslim refugee to appease the national GOP base. He took leadership role in this discriminatory crusade, appearing on national TV to preach his ignorance. This particular event managed to throw multiple refugee settlement organizations into disarray--which, by the way, actually include the Catholic Church of Indiana (the arch bishop of Indianapolis publicly criticized the governor)--and several Syrian refugees which were well into the process of moving to Indiana had to be relocated to another state. Pence didn\'t back down until the courts affirmed that his order was unconstitutional. He shut down a highly successful energy efficiency program--one of the first in the nation, making Indiana a trailblazer--initiated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission with the support of previous governor Mitch Daniels. He did this for no good reason, other than to signal to his far-right constituents that he was fighting against Obama\'s evil despotic EPA.   This is all just in his three years in office. He is reviled across the state, and especially so in Indianapolis. There is (was--now that he\'s the VP nominee, he can no longer be governor) a bipartisan Pence Must Go campaign to get rid of him, and there are literally billboards and yard signs plastered all over the city. Pence is, by virtually all objective measures, one of the worst governors in recent Indiana history, at least in terms of working for the benefit of the state. He has basically focused on far-right Christian social conservative interests to the clear detriment of all else, most importantly the current and future well-being of the state\'s reputation and economy.

It isn\'t like they import labor that are essentially slaves. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Saudi_Arabia Saudi Arabia is a destination for men and women from South East Asia and East Africa trafficked for the purpose of labor exploitation, and for children from Yemen, Afghanistan, and Africa trafficking for forced begging. Hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers from Pakistan, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya migrate voluntarily to Saudi Arabia; some fall into conditions of involuntary servitude, suffering from physical and sexual abuse, non-payment or delayed payment of wages, the withholding of travel documents, restrictions on their freedom of movement and non-consensual contract alterations. According to international organizations such as Ansar Burney Trust, young children from Bangladesh and India are also smuggled to Saudi Arabia to be used as jockeys. The children are underfed to reduce their weights, in order to lighten the load on the camel. The Government of Saudi Arabia does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so. Saudi Arabia has moved from Tier 2 to Tier 3 because of its lack of progress in anti-trafficking efforts, particularly its failure to protect victims and prosecute those guilty of involuntary servitude. Despite reports of trafficking and abuses of domestic and other unskilled workers and children, there is evidence of only one Saudi Government prosecution of a Saudi employer for a trafficking-related offense during the reporting period. Some victims of abuse, due to procedural hurdles, choose to leave the country rather than confront their abusers in court. They are required first to file a complaint with the police before they are allowed access to shelters. The government offers no legal aid to foreign victims and does not otherwise assist them in using the Saudi criminal justice system to bring their exploiters to justice. If a victim chooses to file a complaint, he or she is not allowed to work. The Saudi Government does, however, provide food and shelter for female workers who file complaints or run away from their employers. Criminal cases are adjudicated under Sharia law, and there is no evidence trafficking victims are accorded legal assistance before and during Sharia legal proceedings. then we have this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) persons in Saudi Arabia face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT residents, and Saudi Arabia is considered to have one of the worst LGBT rights records in the world. Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal. LGBT rights are not recognized by the government of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi social mores and laws are heavily influenced by Arab tribal customs and ultra-conservative Wahhabi Islam. Homosexuality and transgenderism are widely seen as immoral and indecent activities, and the law punishes acts of homosexuality or cross-dressing with punishments ranging from fines, floggings, to life in prison, death, and torture. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5250131/Saudi-police-arrest-everybody-involved-gay-wedding.html Saudi police arrest \'everybody involved\' after footage of \'gay wedding\' causes an outcry on social media',

That\'s not omitting, that\'s just how you see it because it doesn\'t line up with your views. Again, they are NOT required to put everything word for word when it can be summed up in one word (which is modest) it doesn\'t matter if it\'s jellaba or whatever because the idea is that it\'s modest, and in the video he only says jellaba to give an example.

In case you have not seen my edit from before, the Sheikh published a clarification on what he meant. ',

This clarification you posted is him clarifying that he did not imply people should not wear hijab and that women should still dress modestly. He literally starts his tweet with "لم أدعُ إلى خلع الحجاب" which would roughly translate to "I did not claim women should stop wearing hijab". Hijab and abaya are DIFFERENT things. Some people thought that he was arguing women should not wear hijab (or even not dress modestly), which is nonsensical because that\'s not what he said and that\'s not what we were talking about in our little discussion.

		ments: [
			'Facebook is a gossip platform, not a news platform. The reactive behavior design does not lend itself to factual content. Without provable fairness, social sites will remain cesspools. ',
			'Thats actually the simplest I\'ve seen it explained. A gossip platform. That\'s what I\'ll tell people.',
			'That\'s exactly why I stopped using it and came over to Reddit. Whenever I tried to make an insightful comment on a serious article in a serious group, people would just spew non-facts and rumors back at me. Which would then devolve into an argument based on the two most common biases, and eventually into a war of shitty memes. Never once did the actual facts matter. Edit: Since I keep getting a lot of the same repsonses, I\'d like to clarify a bit. The mod teams and their ability to set their own rules on subs is what I believe makes the most difference. That makes it so you can choose how to use Reddit. On Facebook, the rules are universal and the mods are all part of corporate, making it so that you encounter the same garbage no matter what group you\'re on.  Yes, a lot of the same stuff goes on here, that\'s just part of social media. But it\'s more regulated and avoidable here.',
			'ockquote> That\'s exactly why I stopped using it  Which is fair deal but I never thought Facebook was for that use. It\'s not for engaging people, and more importantly not for engaging strangers. It\'s just not. Facebook is pretty great for keeping a network of friends and distant acquaintances. People I had lost touch with for years I\'ve reconnected through it. Also people who had moved away, then I moved away, and all the sudden we realize we\'re on the same city and reconnect. It\'s fantastic and I\'d like to know if there\'s a better tool for that job. But not once have I posted or read any actual content, especially text.',

			'ockquote> Facebook is pretty great for keeping a network of friends and distant acquaintances.  The problem is that there isn\'t much money in that.

			'How\'s Reddit different ?',
			'Sometimes, it isn\'t. But groups are moderated much better over here, with some subs deleting any off-topic posts. Serious subs really do tend to stay more serious. ',
			'It’s also possible to downvote in Reddit. Downvotes of course aren’t always based on fact, but with Facebook, one must dig through a sea of emotional, irrational responses, to maybe find the one factual comment. I think having the “like” and limited reaction buttons on Facebook lend to people’s perceptions of the sources. Almost everything on Facebook is “up”. ',
			'Yea but down votes create echo chambers. Drop a rational or at least well thought out argument against one of reddits favorite subjects; basic income, one line historical fact used to sum up complex situations, anti-religion, Utopian socialist states, anti-Americanism, etc. And you are shown to be "wrong" when really what you are being is unpopular.  I would say, entirely anecdotal, down votes are used at least two to three times as much to say I disagree then you\'re not contributing to the conversation. ',
			'Oh I completely agree that downvotes are not perfect, and can often be bad in certain circumstances, but for people like my aunts, or grandpa, who only see “yes” (likes, upvotes) on Facebook posts (and where disagree is just an ignore), they don’t even get the visual marker or option to see people disagree, regardless of the conversation that may or may not have followed. If someone says something completely absurd in the comments, the only option is to “angry emoji” or respond, which is often a headache on public posts (closely moderated groups are often better about this) or there just isn’t the time for.  I don’t know if they fixed it or not, but Facebook a little while ago made it so that comments with the most replies got bumped to the top, instead of most likes (or time posted/linear). This is useful if the conversation is rational and thought out, but in my (also anecdotal) experience, it is the screaming matches and drama comments that float to the top. I really don’t mean this to be a “in defense of downvotes” but more, “only being able to upvote” can have its negative consequences too. ',
			'But then what does upvote stand for? It could be i like this, or it could be this is correct. ',
			'What’s correct also depends on the individual subreddit culture and guidelines. ',
			'I wonder if it would help if individual posters were only allowed one or some other lmited amount of downvotes per thread. So someone could upvote to theit heart’s content, but their downvotes couldn’t just be rained down on all comments that deviate slghtly from their preferred opinion. It would also keep the downvote brigades at bay somewhat.',

Neat.) without having to call/email them, and vice-versa I\'ve never had the issue of my facebook being full of garbage.... mostly because i use facebook properly.  the rare times someone posts some BS website, i just select "show no more from this website" or whatever the wording is. couple that with an adblock, and all i see on facebook are pictures of distant relatives\' children/pets, and some silly jokes.',

They are moving ever so slowly towards more and more social features like the personal page and aspects of the redesign.  Ultimately, Reddit is popular enough that they don\'t have to dilute their product and ape every feature like Twitter did with Facebook features but they certainly want the stickiness and mass appeal that other social media networks have. They don\'t want to be a forum and is why they talk about bridging communities and people in their positioning/mission statement rather than boards or things like that. ',

Once they took out the option to sort by recent, they officially told us they don\'t care about what we want. It\'s super simple to have two modes, one with the algorithm, and one with recent. It really takes no extra work to keep both, but they chose money. If there is any company I think is made out of pure evil, it\'s definitely Facebook.

I remember back when FB was a good place to see what friends where doing and sort of plan events and things. In my opinion, it died when I suddenly started to see people that weren\'t my friends (non-friends and family members) commenting on my posts. By the time they revamped the privacy settings, it was too late. Another nail in the coffin is when they re-did the newsfeed. I want to see what my friends were up to. Instead, FB automatically filtered out "less popular posts" and replaced them with shit I wasn\'t interested in and didn\'t even subscribe to.',
			'We\'ll said. I use FB or personal use and for my business.  Over the last year I\'ve noticed it getting worse, for both uses.  I don\'t see anything fun or interesting in my personal feed anymore, often when I do I\'ll make a comment and then realize it was posted 3 days ago.... The other day I posted to a patriots playoff post to find out it was from last year lol As a business, I\'m a small local business with 1800 followers and post stuff once in awhile. I used to get 500 views on a page and sometimes pay to get more and get new eyes to see it.  Now I will be lucky to get 100 organicly, I can pay $10 to get maybe 1000 views and there is much less interaction with my posts.  I thought it was me, messing up and not posting correctly but I\'m finding it is FB users are not logging in like they used too and they changed to make it harder to get "free" views.  If someone is following my business page, it\'s because they want to see a new deal, or a cool process that we do, or our front desk girls birthday ect,  If they don\'t want to see, they can unfollow us, the new idea to have us pay money to get my post to show up on a followers feed is outlandish.  FB is no longer useful as a user or a company, I don\'t see it lasting long. ',
			'To add to this, there is basically two kinds of companies trying to push their marketing on FB; generic paid for advertising and made-to-be-viral stuff (think Unilad). Whereas FB used to derive it\'s content from users posting baby pics, it\'s now users reposting memes which were designed to be reposted memes. Essentially FB is a self publicising platform without any editorial oversight up front. The only editing done is if a rule is broken, not because the content is bad/copied/irrelevant/propaganda. When we realise that actual content editing is important....even such as Reddit breaking down posts into subs...then social media will become relevant and interesting again.',

Purity to clean up the ads and rest of the crap I don\'t want. It can even block posts by keywords. Unfollow any Friends that join an MLM...  Now I get nearly all original content from Friends instead of third-party crap. FaceBook is for oversharing pics of your kids and pets, Reddit is for the rest.',

They want to see when an employee has a birthday and see the cake, they wanna see our new deal or new product, they want our bad hair day jokes (it\'s a salon)  But now it\'s worthless unless I pay $5 or more a post, and FB messages me and bugs me saying this post is amazing you should boost it more.... FB spams me once or twice a day to boost on their FB messager. So annoying ',
			'Still doesn\'t really work even with the customisation though. Yes, you see less crap but you don\'t see more of the content from your friends because the ranking algorithms used means some people\'s status shows higher than others even if its older, other people updates get buried for no discernable reason, or you click on to read one update then navigate back and everything has been reorganised and posts you were going to read are no longer showing. Urgh, I just want to see status updates in date order with no weightings or preference order. Like it used to be. But I guess that\'s not a profitable way to show this. Maybe there\'s a 3rd party Facebook app driven by APIs or something that does this? Only showing status updates and pictures, no shared articles, no weightings... Hmm. ',

You decide." -- "cell phones might be causing breast cancer, stop putting your phones in your bras!"

I know there are definitely real problems with the platform but I\'m on there every day and for me it\'s just like another, different source where I get all sorts of art, music, and media posts for inspiration, as well as interaction with groups relevant to my interests. God I know how much that sounded like shilling, and I\'m truly not a facebook fanboy or anything. I just feel like leaving the site just because some shit is on there is like not watching anything on Youtube just because there are people like Logan Paul, keemstar, and so on.

Only thing different here is it\'s anonymous so people can be even nastier and divisive.',

Facebook knows its platform is used for bullying, harassment, fake news and all sorts of unpleasant behaviour by individuals, organisations and even governments. Yet it washes its hands of responsibility, hoovering up our personal online data, contacts, habits and passes them on for profit. Zuckerberg and his board of directors are a bunch of slimy assclowns.

			'I got a master\'s degree in mental health counseling, and while in school, developed my own conspiracy theory as to why people can\'t get better.  In layman\'s terms, the antidepressants don\'t deal with the right chemicals depressed ppl are lacking (the lack of serotonin/dopamine). I remember a professor telling me that there\'s only one antidepressant that works on the proper receptors, and that\'s Wellbutrin. Opiates are the only other drugs that do.  When nature/nurture causes your brain to never learn to expell dopamine/serotonin properly (for example, if you experienced successes and had parents who got angry when you were happy, your brain would learn to trigger cortisol/adrenaline instead, so every time happiness SHOULD be experienced, you were taught to experience stress related to the event and that\'s how your brain ends up being \'wired\'), the only way to fix that is to artificially replace that mechanism. Which is why so many ppl self-medicate with opiates with mental illness and also why they get hooked so easily. When you\'ve never had those feel-good chemicals before, ppl will report feeling a "wholeness" they\'ve never felt before.  I may be entirely wrong, but I feel that opiate addiction happens bc of the chemical imbalance in their brains being temporarily fixed by the substance and also why ppl don\'t really have great success with anti-depressants (bc they don\'t deal with the right chemicals the person is lacking).  I think that\'s where the euphoric feeling comes from, as it\'s a naturally occurring chemical in ppls brains, and someone that has been robbed in nature/nurture is a million times more likely to be hooked on opiates. It\'s the shortage of serotonin/dopamine they normally have being temporarily fixed by the release of the chemicals by the drug. Someone whose brain was trained by their environment to release these chemicals from birth wouldn\'t be be as easily hooked bc they get small releases day in and day out, so the experience isn\'t so overwhelming and "new." So essence I believe that opiates temporarily fix the chemical imbalance/shortage of dopamine/serotonin that no antidepressants work on.  Please, please, PLEASE don\'t think I\'m saying to self-medicate with opiates for depression. I\'m saying that once the pharmaceutical industry has benefitted and regulated the opiates as strictly as they can for pain management, there may someday be information come about that will state opiates work for depression. If only to train the brain to tie the right chemicals to the proper emotions. For instance someones brain that has been trained to tie cortisol/adrenaline to things that SHOULD produce serotonin and dopamine (one reason I think apathy and anhedonia occurs over time when the brain constantly gets the improper chemical over time), it could be coupled with therapy to retrain the brain to tie those events to the proper chemicals. I was raised by narcissists so I understand how warped your biology can get from improper nurture. Hence the euphoria side effect ppl get from opiates. That\'s those feel good chemicals bathing the brain that most ppl with depression have trouble producing themselves; or are never released in the first place. I also think that\'s why mdma is starting to be used for PTSD. It\'s just one big release of those chemicals that are built up on the brain and mdma causes the brain to release those chemicals. Someone who experiencing more negative things in their daily lives would have HUGE reserves built up that are never being expressed. They\'re just stuck there until they\'re artificially discharged.  I\'m probably 100% wrong, but I think about this a whole lot. Ultimately substance abuse is a chemical dependency on a chemical that\'s naturally occurring in our bodies; and for a lot of ppl, it\'s a chemical imbalance bc of what we\'ve experienced. It\'s a catch 22 though bc, just like antidepressants, you\'d have to take a pill every day and be left with dependence (unless, like I said, there\'s some sort of system that it\'s only used for brain rewiring or something; not just use the opiate as an end). Same as taking antidepressants, though, really.  I\'m not sure if I believe it\'s a secret bc it\'s a business and they want to sell antidepressants and hoard the opiates to sell for pain or if it\'s all just too perfect to profit on both the way it is or what? It\'s probably that I\'m wrong. Just my thoughts on it. ',

Not only is it likely more complex than that, I\'d almost say it might be the case that it\'s more about neurological architecture; though neurotransmitter levels would no doubt play a role in that.  As for brain rewiring, psychedelics like DMT have been shown to do that, but there\'s little research currently on what those structural changes mean exactly.

			'The thing is that you don\'t simply "treat" depression or mental illness in general. You can give people medication but that will only help some of them.

One does not simply treat depression and hope then people will be able to work once again.',

This is a very good sign of your mental capacity, shows that you have much much potential and have a good chance to a full recovery. Second, you are absolutely right that social integration is so important for you. Church is always a good place to start, because there are nice people there. Casual things like volunteering in a community is also good way to do. Don\'t put pressure on yourself though, do it in your own pace. Thirdly, I would suggest you find a good doctor and therapist. May I also ask what drug are you currently on? Lastly, since you are obviously an intelligent individual, I would suggest you do some research yourself on mental diseases. Understanding physiology of your brain, psychology of your thought process, mechanisms of drugs etc, is often helpful. Don\'t worry too much about job. Opportunity will come. My best wishes to you.

Because of the number of individual factors at play treatment and response to treatment is varied. There are options out there, and if you or someone you know is depressed, you should really be seeking help. It isn\'t something one has to face totally alone.

Compliance is a huge issue. Even I struggle with it. Cost and access are massive issues that prevent people from getting care as well as social stigma and denial. Half the battle is making the moves towards getting treatment. I’ve been treating my mental illness (bipolar 1) for more than half my life. I work full time, at times held 2 jobs, and make a great salary. I’ve also had to be hospitalized twice when my medications needed adjusting and I wasn’t able to treat myself at home while severe symptoms arose.

			'I have a minor nit to pick with the headline. Doesnt it mean that a $1 treating mental health/depression restores $2.50 worth of productivity? My local paper said it costs my city $30,000 a year to deal with a homeless person because they often end up in the criminal justice system from a variety of reasons, from theft to minor offenses like loitering. If we gave them housing assistance an help finding work and/or dealing with mental health would cost $10,000. So changing how we deal with the homeless would either allow us to either save 67% of the money budgeted or for the same money help 200% more people get out of homelessness. Have we changed anything?

But honestly I wonder how this would affect their odds of gaining good paying employment after a large gap in employment due to treating mental health issues. They would be treating depression/mental health rather than curing it so there is a better chance of relapse than if there were a cure, like if someone had cancer or organ failure or severe virus like mono where there would be a point where they\'d be cured and after treatment no longer affected by said ailment.

Not really \'mental\' but labelled mental because society has eaten them and couldnt give a fuck. why? Because its quicker and cheaper to assume that drugs that change the mind work better than human compassion and care. edit: some people are mentally ill yes. people who have hallucinations, demons, constant life of pain and hate of themselfs. but more people now are passed off as a \'condition\' but really need social help and therapy more than pills to help get their life in order, thus unlocking the secret door to jump past the anxiety and start moving forward.

Well when none of them pills worked as they promised and my mind and life NO different.

You fill this world with beauty and vitality, giving warmth and comfort, cordiality and harmony with your tenderness and generosity of spirit.  Most importantly, we love and treasure you. No wonder men have been celebrating women in music and poetry for centuries. Konstantin Balmont, a Russian Silver Age poet, described women in a vivid and precise manner: A woman – with us when we are born, a woman – with us in our last hour, a woman – our standard during battle, a woman – the joy of open eyes. We always turn to women for inspiration and consolation, and always find it. Women give us life and perpetuate it in our children"  - Vladimir Putin  I bet you don\'t find that in the clickbait news articles that circulate here on Reddit.',
			'ockquote> "When people push boundaries too far, it\'s not because they are strong but because they are weak," Putin said. "But maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman." 2014 In 2013, he said of a protest staged by topless women from the activist group Femen: “I liked it ... I didn’t catch what they were shouting, I didn’t even see if they were blondes, brunettes, or chestnut-haired.” In February of this year [2017] Putin signed a horrifying law decriminalizing domestic abuse, which, in Russia and elsewhere, disproportionately victimizes women. Estimates from police data suggest that more than 600 Russian women are killed in their homes every month, the BBCreported.  No but I have these small examples ',
			'Nice that you take those out of context.  First one was said about Clinton, a person Putin hates personally more than anyone else in the US diplomatic scene. He made a point that Clinton was pushing too far with her criticism of Russia to compare it to Nazi Germany, which is just objectively ridiculous.  Second one is also a valid point. If you resort to the lowest form of shock value - nudity in a public scene - you are not going to be taken seriously and it detracts from your cause/message. It\'s cheap and low effort. Putin is right. The topless stunts only cheapens the cause.  Third one is about exposing more nuance to the Russian legal system, which does not function the same way as it does in the US. Decriminalizing something doesn\'t mean men can now beat up women, it means that there is more room to take context into account when sentencing someone than before...which is a good thing and something that the Russian domestic violence laws lacked.

			'To be fair, nowadays there\'s a lot of debate about the legitimacy of that definition of "socialist" and "socialism", becuase on that basis no socialists exist who participate in democracies. Like an extremely left wing social democrat, someone who wants to establish socialism by being elected- are they not a socialist? The dictatorship of te proletariat to establish communism cannot be the only definition of socialism today; the ideology has evolved and many democrats in western liberal systems consider themselves socialists. A few SDPs are in power, that makes those democracies to some extent socialist.',
			'ockquote> Like an extremely left wing social democrat, someone who wants to establish socialism by being elected- are they not a socialist?  They\'re socialist IF they believe the means of production should be owned by the working class. You\'re correct to acknowledge socialism as a term and the specifics can not be entirely nailed down to 1 thread of thought. If you\'ve ever read Marx\'s manifesto, you\'ll quickly realize he addressed like 3-4 types of "socialism" in his day. You\'ll also quickly realize he didn\'t invent the word. There were plenty of groups using the word before Marx, with different agendas. Marx would have probably classed a social democrat as a "bourgeois socialist", in a mocking manner, because they don\'t want to entirely disrupt the bourgeoisie but rather quell any contempt of the proletariat by giving them "just enough" to pacify their concerns. Like we\'ll give you healthcare, education, and housing if you really need it, but you\'re not going to own the means of production. Similar to Elon Musk talking about giving just enough universal basic income to people in the age of robots.  Socialism goes beyond the welfare programs of social democracies though, it goes to the root of who controls the means of production. Who "owns" the factory?',
			'That doesn\'t mean his country doesn\'t take on socialist ideals in any of their systems. Socialism and capitalism aren\'t black and white, they can coexist. See: countries with socialized healthcare, with private healthcare operating in tandem.',
			'No, you\'re right to a certain extent that many countries can\'t implement pure capitalism. Social programs are band aids to the glaring holes in capitalism that Marx diagnosed in the 1840\'s. Like he essentially predicted Universal Basic Income, or at least the necessity of it as a contradiction in capitalism. Any system that gives incentive to replacing the worker, has to do something with the worker when he\'s replaced. I wouldn\'t call that socialism and capitalism coexisting though. That\'s capitalism being patched by social programs. Socialism is the worker\'s ownership of production.',
			'That is mostly correct, however it doesn\'t just mean ownership by the worker, it includes state ownership as well. If a system is entirely funded via tax, and therefore entirely owned by the state for use by everyone in society - that is to say things like healthcare, infrastructure, welfare - then they are supported by socialist policies. That is way more than a bandage on society, these are structured from the top down. I think particularly in the US, it\'s almost a sin to attribute these things to socialism because of its inherent demonisation there, and why some people incorrectly attribute it to social democracy instead. Western European countries may not be socialist in the strict sense, though I doubt there will ever be such a country, but they absolutely have socialist elements, and I\'d consider it mental gymnastics to argue otherwise.',
			'At least with the former the benefits would be spread across a greater number of people',
			'That was the idea, at least written by Marx. Every system has a ruling group and an oppressed group. Capitalism was pretty new in the 1840\'s, with Feudalism, Monarchies, Caste systems, Tribal systems all sorts of systems preceding it in human history. Each new system was transitioned into the next by power transferring from one group to the next. Marx wanted the ruling group to be the biggest group, with the hope that groups themselves would eventually just disappear and humanity could transition into a classless and stateless existence.',
			'I like Marx\'s ideas but they don\'t seem very effective in practice, so far. Capitalism is effective but leads to inequality and the tragedy of the commons, it appears. Maybe something in between the two could work.',

			'ockquote> but I think it\'s equally, if not more, likely that she does actually represent some opposition to Putin,  There\'s no reason to think she\'s genuine and quite a lot to think otherwise.  If she were a real opponent she would be forbidden to take part in the election like Navalny is. If she were real opposition she would get arrested constantly for minor or no reasons, she would get threaten and beaten up, she would have chemicals thrown in her face that temporarily blind her. That\'s what happens to real opposition in Russia. Sometimes they straight up murder them too. ',

			'Putin\'s former boss who died under incredibly suspicious circumstances while on a trip organised by Putin. Since I\'m being downvoted:   But once Putin launched his election campaign, he appointed his former boss his "empowered representative"— a job that basically entitled Sobchak to campaign for Putin  ...  Sobchak was reminiscing, in response to questions asked by other journalists, and recounting key episodes of Putin’s career in ways that contradicted the story told by his old protégé.  ...  On February 17, 2000, Putin asked Sobchak to travel to Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania, to campaign for him. The request was urgent: Sobchak had to fly out that day...On February 20, Sobchak died at a private hotel in a resort town outside Kaliningrad. Local journalists soon picked up on some odd circumstances surrounding Sobchak\'s death. Chief among them was the fact that two different autopsies had been performed on the body—one in Kaliningrad and one in St. Petersburg, at the military hospital run by Yuri Shevchenko, the same doctor who had helped engineer Sobchak\'s escape to Paris; he was now Russia’s minister of health, but he had not given up his post at the hospital. The official cause of death was a massive but natural heart attack. Still, ten weeks following Sobchak\'s death, the prosecutor\'s office in Kaliningrad opened an investigation into a possible case of "premeditated murder with aggravating circumstances." Three months later, the investigation was closed without a finding.  ...  Back in Paris, Arkady Vaksberg decided to launch his own investigation into his acquaintance\'s death. He was never a close friend or even a great fan of the imperious Russian politician, but he was an investigative journalist with actual forensics experience and a great nose for a story. It was Vaksberg who dug up the most puzzling detail of the circumstances of Sobchak\'s death: the two bodyguard-assistants, both physically fit young men, had had to be treated for mild symptoms of poisoning following Sobchak\'s death. This was a hallmark of contract killings by poisoning: many a secretary or bodyguard had fallen similarly ill when their bosses were killed. In 2007, Vaksberg published a book on the history of political poisonings in the USSR and Russia. In it, he advanced the theory that Sobchak was killed by a poison placed on the electrical bulb of the bedside lamp, so that the substance was heated and vaporized when the lamp was turned on. This was a technique developed in the USSR. A few months after the book was published, Vaksberg\'s car was blown up in his Moscow garage; Vaksberg was not in it. ',

			'This isn\'t "my interpretation." The women\'s protests on International Women\'s Day were instrumental in turning Petrograd\'s unrest into actual Revolution. Of course men joined in and were important to the revolution, I can not possibly see how I implied otherwise. But the fact of the matter is that the protests on February 23rd (March 8 NS) began with a massive crowd of women marching through Petrograd demanding equal rights. As the day went on female factory workers, many arriving from Vyborg, joined in and the mood took a more radical turn. By the end of the day hundreds of thousands of men and women were on the streets of Petrograd and a bit more than a week later the Tsar had abdicated. Of course the Revolution required cooperation between men and women. But the protests on that fateful day began as a women\'s march for equality and grew from there. That is very relevant and powerful given that the person I replied to was talking about how Russian women would never dare be politically active or fight for their rights.

			'I\'m inclined to feel the hope of the two countries merging, or finding friendly terms to peacefully live with each other, and trade with each other. Then I remember what I learned reading The Fall of the Third Reich. (please excuse me if I misremember important details) Hitler not to be hindered by Versailles ordered the secret development of his army. However, he was more than aware of the inequality of strength between the rest of the world and his own. He knew that if he was to have any realistic chance to succeed in his long-term goals, he needed a navy that rivaled England, he needed an air force, and he needed a lot more ground troops. So he started building them, funneling funds from the workers funds to pay for it. He also had the astute insight about the war weariness of the allies. He figured there was room to wiggle greater appeasements. So systematically, he started a campaign. On the surface it was anti-war, he gave compelling speeches bestowing the virtues of peace... and most people believed him. So much so that when Hitler first marched into Rhineland in 1936, France failed to act militarily. At the point in time, Hitlers army could have been wiped out, it was still an inferior force. But Hitler\'s gamble paid off, and the shift in the balance of power began. He negotiated deals such as an agreement to have 35% of the navy as England (which they went for, believing it engrained in law their naval advantage) but in reality, allowed Hitler to build a bigger navy. The important thing to learn is, Hitler just didn\'t care about international law. He ignored it or used it to sedate his enemies. So I\'m not sure Kim Jong Un has ambitions that rival Hitler. He always struck me as a kid who just wants to watch some basketball who ended up dictator of a country due to heredity and is now trying to make the best of it, knowing that the whole thing is bigger than himself. Of course, I have no idea what the outside influences here could be, and it\'s possible that the generals surrounding him have a bigger plan. The main problem here is the first steps that look like peace, also look like the beginning of an invasion plan when you\'re outgunned. When you combine that with the facts that, like Hitlers Germany, there\'s some hard to overlook demons in the closet. The amount of human rights abuses CURRENTLY happening in the country, combined with the secret police forces that enforce the fascism of their regime make me think that a peaceful coexistence of their regime is impossible. The two government forms are completely incompatible. The only way for the Koreas to unite seems like would be for one government to collapse.  So when I read something like this, and I remember that a historical picture of N Korea is that of one that has ignored international law repeatedly, my mind has a hard time reconciling that there might be good intentions here.',
			'It\'s not about posturing for a future war. The disparities between NK and the world super powers are such that it would never be an issue.  This is an opportunity being seized to make the US look like the bad guy that is sowing chaos while NK and SK talk like adults.

			'Not only that, but it\'s a way to legitimize NK\'s nuclear weapons. If They work out a treaty that doesn\'t involve disarmament, that\'s another nail in the coffin for NK ever disarming. Furthermore, Kim Jong Un seems to be more interested in economic development than his predecessors, and having enough operational nuclear ICBMs to create a substantial deterrent frees up money for other things.

			'The reason France didn’t intervene when the Rhineland was remilitarised was internal stability, France was practically paralysed for most the 30’s by political instability.

			'Yeah I\'m hoping they work things out but I\'m sceptical as well.',
			'Your comparison with Hitler makes no sense. NK *regime would be obliterated, every single country in the world chipping in the effort, if NK placed 1 foot south of the DMZ. ',
			'Well, let\'s think about NK in a more global picture then. Specifically, let\'s think about Putin. Now Putin is an autocrat who really does have grander ambitions. With Crimea he demonstrated his ambitions, and he demonstrated the war weariness of the European Union. Now we did push back with sanctions, but he\'s hit back a lot harder if you believe he mingled in the US elections. In fact, if you think about an alliance of Russia, China, and NK, combined with the US at war with itself. You have a pretty strong alliance, and a divided weakened opposition force. I\'ve often wondered how NK has made such drastic progress with their missles in such a short time. Many people will speculate they had help from Russia. As the NK threat strengthens, it also divides US military power and focus. If Putin wanted to expand his European war with Ukraine. That\'s a plus. From my point of view, the biggest unknown is where China\'s alliance falls. If China falls on NK\'s side, then there\'s a legitimate opposition force. If it falls on US\'s side, it\'s a non-starter. China has made it clear if NK is an aggressor. It\'s on our side, and if we\'re the aggressor they\'ll be on NK side. So if you are Putin, and if you could orchestrate US aggression on NK. There could be some major advantage. I guess I\'m just letting my mind wander. But I can see scenarios where NK can have a legitimate force.',

			'That\'s not cynical, it is reality. Kim has the missile tech to hit the US mainland, or nearly has it, and now he wants to see what his new toys can do. Now that he believes he is insulated from the same fate as so many dictators before him, that being regime change, he needs to get recognized on the world stage as a legitimate leader that makes deals at the international level. Step one of operation \'Totally a real leader and not an insane dictator\' is legitimacy through association and negotiations with Moon will serve nicely.  While the idea of avoiding war through talks like this is nice it only prolongs and legitimizes the insanity. How can you negotiate in good faith with a leader who has capped every demand with the destruction of Seoul and the death of hundreds of thousands of innocents? There is a reason \'we don\'t negotiate with terrorists\' and telling Kim that he will be met with anything other than force while he holds a gun to the ROK\'s head is an extremely dangerous strategy.',
			'As unsavory as negotiating with the NK regime is, there really isn\'t a better alternative available. Any style of regime change in NK will very likely cause an immediate humanitarian crisis which will last decades in NK and the region at large.

			'North Korea was in a WAY better spot before the fall of the Soviet Union. There were some actual devotion to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for the standard of living they had enjoyed before the famine. The famine had been a logical time for a collapse yes, but back then the government at least had some claim of providing a decent life for more people.  People born in the late 80\'s and on has zero reason to trust the government and are aware of what quality of life the South and the Chinese is enjoying. There is absolutely cause for collapse now. ',
			'What. No, this is completely false. Why do people upvote this? Their military is in complete shambles. Their tank capabilities are at this point literally 2 generations behind what South Korea/NATO countries/Russia have (a fleet of T-55s,T-62s and domestic T-72 variants), submarines are supposedly not leaving port (and they are pretty much all of the power projection they have) and the main fighters of their Air Force 30ish second-hand Mig-29s with god-knows what kind of concoction of avionics and missiles. They are supposed to take on three times their numbers of a fleet of F-16s and F-15s. The whole story that China and Russia is military propping them up false, because well, they have shitty equipment. And they want for NK to continue having shitty equipment, albeit they also want them to be a thorn to the US. The nukes play well into all of that. In the 1950s they had absolute military supremacy over the South (as they have famously shown, albeit they obviously didn\'t have supremacy or parity with the then UN-forces) and in the 60s they still had parity. For South Korea, there isn\'t that much difference between millions of artillery shells on Seoul or nukes.',

The rest of the country suffers. ',

			'If there was any kind of kidnapping or murder, China might be among the first to initiate the retribution. Partly because South Korea is a vital trading partner for China, and they don’t want anything to jeopardise that; but mostly because they’d want to control the North Korean regime’s inevitable downfall in such a way as to prevent an influx of refugees and maintain a buffer zone between the US forces and China.',

China getting into actual military conflict with the US over DPRK would run counter to their last 50 years of governing philosophy and risk a trade partnership that neither side cares to lose. Sure, China may bitch slap Kim if he starts things but they are gonna watch and wait if the US moves first.',

			'America always wants to believe an American action is responsible for anything that happens anywhere. This is simply the result of North Korea completing their nuclear program. Now that they are a nuclear armed state they believe they have sufficient safety/leverage to negotiate on equal footing, and their nuclear program will not be on the table.',

They don\'t need us, and we certainly shouldn\'t be working so incestuously with their awful government but we\'ve long lost control of our own so it\'s not like we have much choice but to work with a party that tries to cover up milk powder scandals and arrests human rights lawyers. I\'m sure you\'re going to patriotically counter with a grand auspicious wave of whataboutism for your 五毛 but it doesn\'t change anything I\'ve said, I probably won\'t even disagree with you because I hate our regimes just as much as the gross, nasty, hip-hop and Winnie the Pooh banning CCP.

My wife in particular despises them, so it isn\'t the rosy picture you may have perceived. The fact that so many people have been lifted out of poverty is fantastic, but again it\'s come at the expense of Americans and American jobs and it sucks, since it was mostly perpetrated by terribly disloyal corporatist Americans.

			'to me, the totality suggests that this was premeditated propaganda bait by the Russians to see if CIA/etc would do something domestically embarassing in context of the Ru investigation. the fact that the negotiation faltered so long, combined with The Intercept citing primarily the Russian source in their version, leads me to believe the Russians sensed USIC stopped caring about the dangle and thus chose to just publicize the story, leaving the implication CIA desired antiTrump info even if CIA in reality went cold at the sight of said info. i understand its convenient to think CIA would make the amateur move of giving their adversary receipts in something that would be an embarassing domestic affair if leaked, but without being caustic (and acknowleding CIA has made dumb plays before, eg using vaccinations to find Osama), i\'ll just say its more likely than not that they turned it down for a variety of practical reasons. the alleged German hacker in the story is most lilely Andy Mueller Maguhn and i\'d wager if anything the USIC was most interested in probing if there was any truth to the idea that he is the missing link between Assange and GRU, more than getting more info on Shadow Brokers/Trump. as for paying for the cyber tools, i do buy that and do think CIA/NSA probably did throw a little of their budget towards that lead, and others have pointed out, its not so much getting the tools back (as that makes no sense) as it is figuring out which ones were compromised.',

			'Heres the thing. Whether you\'re a rightwing apologist yourself or just a hyper-logical argumentative sort, no one is interested in your justifications and deflections, or his. Because principles matter. Everything is not a philosophical puzzle or rhetorical firefight. Society functions on rudimentary shared values. A demonstration of oppressive, anti-democratic ideas is rejected because those are not the values of society, and it doesn\'t matter how well a Richard Spencer or Stephen Miller phrases their bigotry. It doesn\'t matter how many factoids the "conservatives" trot out to support their prejudice. I\'ll say it again. Principles matter. The way that the modern Right has managed to couch their xenophobic hate and regressive worldview in fake "concerns", misinformation, and pseudo-rational arguments is extremely dangerous, and actually right out of the fascism playbook. They have weaponized disinformation along with the reasoning that is constructed to prop it all up. And by the way, the asshat you\'re bending over to defend didn\'t even offer that much. The more the extreme Right grows as a destructive force on the sociopolitical fabric, the more people will resist it. The polarity grows and grows, until either a critical mass is reached to send the regressives back to their dark echo chambers and allow progress to continue, or... it erupts in civil war. That\'s where the world is at, because the rightwing has so successfully created their virtual-reality that people are operating on not only different but oppositional narratives. It\'s unsustainable. If you want to live in a reasonable world, you need to first recognize that there is a brutal assault taking place against truth and reason itself.',

Honestly, I\'m impressed they\'ve been paying them up until now. I know the world\'s largest economy has been whining about paying them, and they don\'t have crippling sanctions imposed on them by the UN. Edit: since 2013 they\'ve been having record harvests, so they\'re not starving starving, but it\'s still pretty bad. Regardless, I for one hope they continue improving their agricultural sector.

A university being an institution that grants graduate degrees and has colleges contained within it (ex. college of engineering or college of nursing). All that to say technically the US has a university system that is the same as Canadas but the colloquial use of college to mean university has made this confusing. 4-year colleges do exist but they are often are more applied degrees like technical schools and many community colleges are starting to transition to this model.

			'ockquote> I\'m shocked they actually listened to the voice of reason rather than the voice of a thousand wallets opening to pay them tuition for this bogus program.  I suspect they listened to lawyers.  Imagine any profession, based on a programme offered by any school that gets banned by the government in future. Not just the course at the school is closed, that happens all the time, but the actual practice of the thing itself. Since the College and the Province authorised it in the first place, they\'re going to be facing lawsuits from students for decades over it. And we know that is going to happen eventually, because the Province and Federal government have a responsibility for consumer protection, and there aren\'t a lot of products you can sell that don\'t work, or do harm (except cigarettes, which are pretty heavily regulated for that reason).  Then you have the fact that this isn\'t some benign thing. Homeopathy is healthcare fraud, plain and simple. Some cancer patient who goes to a homeopath, gets worse, and then either dies or lives long enough to sue them for fraud is going to after the school for having claimed this was legitimate, and again, that\'s not a series of lawsuits you want to be on the receiving end of. ',

Which I was then able to understand and address, long-term. I don\'t know that I would have gotten that from a regular doctor. Of course, the chiropractor also recommended I come back once a week for 6 weeks, and after that once a month (in perpetuity, probably). Finally knowing what the problem was I worked on it myself successfully, and never went back.',
			'An orthopedist or a physical therapist could have probably done the same thing. With the added benefit that PT is covered by insurance and generally they don\'t tell you to keep coming back forever to milk your money. I went for I think 6 weeks, it cured my problem, and they taught me ways to handle it at home should it ever come back. ',

			'My RMR and my physiotherapist have both done similar things :). They also show me how to fix it and how to work on it at home.',

			'TIL the evidence based medicine equivalent of a chiropractor is an orthopedist. When I was growing up my dad talked about how much a chiropractor had helped him with his back problems, it wasn\'t until I started using Reddit that I realized it was something a lot of people were skeptical towards, and it wasn\'t until I googled it just now that I learned it\'s literally a form of alternative medicine.  Edit: Orthopedist or a physical therapist.',
			'I mean, chiropractic is an alternative medicine. For some reason it doesn\'t get the same bad rap as other alternative medicines though, it gets much more of a "hmmm well I don\'t think it works..." instead. The long and the short of it is that chiropractors are quacks. Go see a physiotherapist or an orthopedist, chiropractors barely know what they\'re doing. A family member of mine had a stroke after a chiropractor sliced through her vertebral because he was fucking around with her neck and it got caught between two vertebrae.',

			'What woo woo is involved?',
			'The body is designed along the lines of "innate intelligence". "Innate intelligence" allows your body to have proper "nerve flow", through which it is able to heal itself naturally of any illnesses without any drugs or surgery.  When your spine is misaligned by daily life (or injury), it disrupts the "nerve flow" and creates "dis-ease". By visiting a chiropractor and getting your spine adjusted, he is able to realign your spine along the lines dictated by your body\'s "innate intelligence", thus improving your "nerve flow" and allowing your body to fight off various types of "dis-ease", heal itself from injuries, etc. For example, the creator of chiropractic believed he could cure smallpox through spinal adjustments. If the spine was aligned properly, then the improved "nerve flow" would allow the body to naturally fight off the smallpox virus. ',
			'I used to get massages at a chiropractor\'s office because I followed my massage therapist from her previous job. He had all sorts of crap around his office about subluxation causing cancer and chiro curing it, not getting vaccines because dontcha know they\'re poison and a good adjustment can cure the flu, adjusting various vertebrae will cure everything from diabetes to bunions. It\'s bunk. ',
			'As an x-ray tech I could show you an x-ray and point out to you a million and one made-up but perfectly convincing things.

But if I was getting paid a couple hundred bucks per visit to tell you there\'s something wrong with you that only I could fix, I\'d be a lot more tempted to do so. ',

Up until around 20 or so years ago the Chinese government was suppressing its currency value extremely harshly to keep foreign companies investing into Chinese manufacturing, but now they have enough industrial base (and have largely saturated their export markets anyways) to relax their grip on their financial markets and allow civilians to cash in on their new-found wealth. Of course there is still tons of China that isn\'t industrialized but that is part of the reason they have started focusing on domestic markets for manufacturing as they expect fast and consistent market growth for years to come.',

However, now that China is the 2nd largest GDP and growing in global political influence, it\'s my opinion that western societies need to push China to focus on higher goals for their society. Chinese people are afraid to speak out against their government. China is actively involved in blocking and deleting information that is negative to the CCP. China is building a high-tech surveillance state to increase fear and control over their people. American businesses and western leadership is complicit in these violations of rights because they want access to the marketplace.  China\'s strategy has proven successful in raising a huge population out of poverty (and it still has more work to do) but it is time for the west to raise the expectations now, or risk China pushing their standards for government, media and human rights on the rest of the world.',
			'ockquote> it\'s my opinion that western societies need to push China to focus on higher goals for their society.  Keep in mind that China doesn\'t have the same history, nor the same value as Western countries. They certainly aim "higher" than being on par with the best Western nations, and we very well might disagree on their definition.  China is building a high-tech surveillance state to increase fear and control over their people.  I\'m also afraid this is not specific to China. If anything, they\'re proving to be more effective in embracing technology and implementing it, but we\'re not far behind.',
			'Definitely agree that the west is doing the same and condemning China\'s surveillance state w/o addressing our own would be hypocritical, but that\'s kind of my point. Having a different history does not give China a pass on imprisoning political dissidents.',
			'True, but there are a lot of other stuff that Chinese people and the west may have in dispute - in value. Not just the government; people as well. For example, the mandatory 9 year primary/middle school education. Which, some people say forces children to read content about loving CCP, and some people say it interferes with religious freedom. However, as Chinese I understand it allows everyone to learn basic literature, mathematics and science; also, religious freedom includes the freedom to not believe in any religion. If a young child takes his/her parent\'s religion without being exposed to basic mathematics and science, his/her freedom to not believe in any religion is harmed. Marriage laws - must be monogamy and register in government office; pure religious marriages are disallowed. I\'ll leave the pros and cons of this one to you, and it is very obvious. As for the point "China is building a high-tech surveillance state to increase fear and control over their people", I think that is not entirely correct. What happens right now is definitely not 1984 style; instead, the freedom is taken away, "amusing ourselves to death" style. I would worry more about Arena of Glory than government surveillance. ',
			'Agree, most country will and want to do surveillance but maybe China is more competent in achieving it.',

If they did, they would have ended up like India.  or risk China pushing their standards for government, media and human rights on the rest of the world.  This the perfect example of thinking about China in a completely western way. China doesn\'t want to export its system anywhere. They never considered themselves as a model. In fact, it has always said that nobody can emulate China by copying them directly, and that each country should follow their own path for their own development. China doesn\'t have the evangelist or missionary kind of thing going on like the west does. Just because exporting its system is what the west would do when its in a position of power doesn\'t mean other civilizations hold the same view. ',

Just because exporting its system is what the west would do when its in a position of power doesn\'t mean other civilizations hold the same view.  Eh. The Chinese view is a bit more complicated than that. More accurately, they consider themselves to be a model and to be an example of development that does not involve submission to the West. They will use soft power to export that by showing people how great China has become compared to the world\'s largest democracy, India for example. It is true that they don\'t give a shit what other countries follow though.  China definitely does consider its style of governance and current schools of thought to be a model. While the old sinocentrism is dead, the idea of intrinsic greatness in Chinese civilisation is still very much alive. ',
			'That\'s accurate. I understood it that way as well but your words are far more accurate than mine. I should have said that they never considered themselves as a model FOR EXPORT. As in they will not go around promoting it or forcing it on others. Instead, they want the results to show for itself, and that are willing to teach nations that come to them on their own accord to learn and copy.  tl;dr China\'s not exporting its model. It\'s waiting for other nations to import it. ',
			'Leading by example, rather than imposing itself by force. That\'s also a key point underlined by the Martin Jacques in some of its lectures (not sure if that is in the TED Talk, but it is in its this longer lecture: When China Rules the World). That\'s a fundamental difference, and as Westerners we tend to project our own historical attitude on the "predicted" behaviour of China, mostly by ignorance or arrogance. And we\'re freaking afraid of China, because we\'ve been total dicks in the past.',

Maybe what china is doing is better for them.  In a nutshell, the West simply can\'t understand China by keeping to its own thinking framebox. There is a very interesting TED talk by Martin Jacques that perfectly resumes the situation.

			'That\'s a good point, Western thinkers are basically fixated on the point that economic development basically leads to democracy and a more open society. With the rise of China and Russia\'s resurgence, this has been put into question. What\'s better to say is that a large amount of economic development and a capital market can lead to a more open society, but it\'s not necessarily the case. What I think a lot of people are missing is that while a lot of Chinese certainly would prefer a democratic government, they also would like, just as much or it not more, to see a strong China that puts China back a stature that it once had such as during the Han, Tang or Ming dynasties. At those periods in history, China was unquestionably the military, technological and cultural center of the East.',

We do not, we accept people who are willing to change to be like us, and spit out all who oppose our morals.',

Whether anything can transcend westphalian sovereignty or whether we need to recompile the list of rights we believe to be universal to all is up for debate though. ',

Even if you look at modern politics, it\'s more of the same. They will never fully embrace Western ideologies. Hong Kong was a British colony for 150+ years. For that entire time, the Brits ruled with corruption and heavy handed politics. in 1995, 2 years before the handover back to China, they allow democratic policies, pretty much a spit in the face to China.  Chinese people are afraid to speak out against their government.  That just isn\'t true at all. Places like https://club.kdnet.net/ are full of political complaints. https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2012/02/rising-protests-in-china/100247/  After several days, the government gave in, admitting to mistakes and vowing to crack down on corruption. Villagers were also allowed to hold their first-ever secret ballot elections, apparently free from Communist Party interference. On February 11, 2012, Wukan residents elected their own governing committee, with a voter turnout of 85 percent.  I think the problem with most views on China is that most people don\'t see the amount of bias there is in Western media when it comes to reporting on China. It\'s pretty similar to your comment. For some reason people think the people of China need or even want you to impose your ideologies on them. As for the security state, honestly, as someone who has always been paranoid in my being born and raised in the US, in China, that feeling goes away. I no longer have to suspect somebody may be watching, they\'re straightforward about it, I know they\'re watching. Now I just have to care about whether I do something that they care enough to pay attention.',

			'ockquote> The Qing Dynasty brought its woes upon itself with complacent and hubris  Have you heard of the Beiyang Army? How about the Self-Strengthening movement? The Qing tried to reform. They did the right things, really. Unfortunately, they weren\'t quite fast enough, but that\'s because they had less time, not because they were complacent. The Century of Humiliation started in 1839, thirty years before Meiji. If anyone was complacent, it was Japan; a British warship shelled Nagasaki to force them to resupply in 1807, and the Shogunate\'s response was to double down on sakoku. If the Brits and Americans had decided after, say, the Morrison incident in 1837 that the Shogunate had to go, Japan would have been far more screwed than China ever was. Luckily for Japan, it was a poor, underdeveloped shithole compared to China, and not worth the bother. ',

"You are bad, we are good. Liberal democracy, constitutional republicanism and capitalism must spread! Conform or else..."  Not every country has to mimic the western form of democracy and governance.  Clearly China is doing incredibly good things by being exactly what they are. Vertical power structure, tight control on the spread of information and propaganda...and being communist. They don\'t have a market economy and they have a very authoritarian bureaucracy that works lightning fast on big changes.  I\'d say we should honor the fact that they are different and growing faster than any country in history ever.',

			'In the sense that they have a one party system, it\'s literally called the Communist party, China doesn\'t have a market economy and all companies are required to have a Communist Party committee that oversee the company and project the will and power of the state when necessary.  I work in a company that\'s going to be selling a product in China this year and just getting the right approvals from the Communist Party and the ministry of culture is very different to almost anywhere else in the world.  I\'d say China has re-branded Communism by bringing some of the old and mixing it with a little new.  No country is 100% capitalist, socialist or communist...I think.',

It\'s my opinion that China is already far ahead.  Not a democracy (we mustn\'t give power to idiots). At least espousing socialist and communist ideals which is reflected by many of their laws (very far ahead of the West where these positions are opposed or illegal). Significantly lower per capita pollution yet already doing more than the West to fight pollution (nothing short of amazing). Much better track record in regards to conflict and war. Throughout history and today. Is not pushing their political system on everyone else. Great focus on education, technology and infrastructure (the West is making steps backwards in that regard, especially by privatizing these things).  China isn\'t as rich and developed yet and still in many ways a developing country. It definitely should not become more like West. The rest of your com.ent is pretty much the usual propaganda we are spammed with 24/7 in the West. Not really something that hasn\'t been discussed more than enough. A key thing to keep in mind is that you should worry about these things in the West to avoid being hypocritical when criticizing China... and not really worry so much about it in China where people have different values to begin with and don\'t really mind as much (if at all, I would say the Chinese government and its control has more public support than the average Western "democratic" government).',

The whole situation is still undergoing. But it was reported that the whole thing was a coordinated Iranian-Syrian ambush in the style that brought down the F-117 over Serbia in 1999. It was also reported that up a vast number of missiles were used, as well as some cannon fire. S-200 missiles were seen crashed on Israeli territory on the Golan, and they triggered alarms all across the Golan region.  The estimate is that these missiles were set to detonate at a specific point rather than seek the aircraft in a normal fashion, and were fired en masse (about 25 missiles were reported to be used) with the assumption that statistically, at least one would hit through shrapnel. According to IDF statement, it is not yet known if the reason for the pilots\' ejection was the result of being physically hit by the missiles. Now going by my info, it\'s normal for a pilot to eject if he sees that his chances of avoiding the missiles are slim and that if they\'d hit, they might instantly kill him. This is the exact thing that Israel feared for a long time and has been lobbying the Russians to try and prevent. Iranian troops are now at a point where they can coordinate such complicated ambushes and even attacks on Israel. If tomorrow a war erupts between Israel and Hezbollah, Syria will be a 2nd front.',

The policy basically says that for every attack Israel is subject to (by Gazan terrorists or by Syrian), it will reply several times more powerfully against the responsible party. So even if Islamic Jihad fired a rocket from Gaza, it will be Hamas targets that get hit, to force Hamas to reign in the other terrorists, and similarly to hit Assad to force him to focus on securing the Israeli border. Since if Israel were to hit the terrorists, Assad would basically find it convenient for them to gather there because Israel would do part of his job for him. So no matter who fires at Israel, Assad gets hit. This is the first time I personally hear of non-Assad bases getting hit in Syria, i.e. the Iranian bases. Presumably because this is the first time Iran has directly acted in this way, and that hitting Assad will not teach the usual lesson, so it needed to hit Iran too.',

			'I beg to differ... The Lebanese border has never been calmer.',
			'You cannot defeat a guerilla force hiding in civilian towns, deeply entrenched unless you\'re willing to fight total war like Assad did in Syria. Israel might\'ve been willing to make Lebanon pay for housing and supporting Hezbollah, by destroying any infastructure it could justify. But it would\'ve never destroyed Hezbollah as a whole. It could\'ve killed every single last Hezbollah fighter, by flattening every single Hezbollah aligned village, and Iran would just send more money to hire and train new thugs. And Hezbollah would have even more propaganda with the resulting civilian casualties to boot. So you must define what "winning" is. If Hezbollah defines "winning" as still existing... yes, they still existed after 2006. All of the major Hezbollah figures hid underneath a bunker that some Israelis believe to be under the Iranian embassy. And none died. So I guess by their standards, they "won". But on the other hand Israel lost no land, took no major damage, killed more people than it lost and destroyed the shit out of Lebanon- and the violence stopped with a UN resolution that "forced" Hezbollah to disarm. I mean don\'t see how you could say Israel lost. But hey, if you want to make yourself feel better by saying so, go ahead...',
			'I just love how you put it "killed more people than it lost". Israel killed 1,200 lebanese civilians and 250 Hezbollah fighters while Hezbollah killed 45 israeli civilians and 120 IDFs clearly, hezbollah was the strategic and warfare victor',
			'There\'s a problem with your numbers, and its the same issue Israel has with Hamas. Guess who reports Hezbollah casualty figures? Well, that would be Hezbollah. And like Hamas, Hezbollah likely underreports casualties since it depends on propaganda of Israeli brutality on civilians to gain world opinion, as well as the ability to claim victory to maintain support in Lebanon. Israel\'s tally of dead Hezbollah fighters is 600 to 700. But like I said, if it helps you sleep at night... yep, you won the strategery and the victories. Congrats. Now stop attacking us.',
			'Look man, I\'m a Lebanese, I live in Dahiye Beirut (a hezbollah stronghold), I\'ve lived here my entire life. It\'s one thing that Hezbollah can never lie about is their casualties. And that\'s due to their very doctrine and the way they operate. For every Hezbollah fighter that dies in action, they do this very over-the-top and flamboyant display of a memorial in support of the families and communities of the deceased. They just can\'t hide a dead soldier! impossible! they\'d face tremendous shit from the families.',
			'Hezbollah figures probably reflected official overt fighters. Consider that not all Hezbollah fighters were overt, or official members. Hezbollah has a much more organized cadre department today, but even now there are probably fighters \'in reserve\' who are officially part of LAF / police, but have allegiance to Hezb. and will take part in hostilities. Israeli figures probably relied on cross referencing published casualty names with anyone who came up in the context of being connected to the organization in intel files. Consider people hiding weapon or missile stocks in their homes, or civilians who volunteer for recon / logistic duties.  Obviously both sides had competing interests in the casualty number.',
			'Yes that\'s great reasoning. I agree.',
			'Huh, this is a good point, but even the UN estimated that 500 Hezbollah fighters lost their lives during the war... which makes Hezbollah\'s claim less likely.',
			'That\'s interesting, I didn\'t know this. Have they ever done a display for a group of dead as a whole? Also, where do these displays happen? In Beirut or something? Or in the villages of the fallen? It could be that Hezbollah had made more celebrations than the total death count they released. It\'s interesting to hear that they can\'t actually hide the fighter itself, but the final tally can surely be meddled with if the celebrations are word of mouth and are not recorded?',
			'Ah yes! I\'ve seen these displays on TV. Hezbo has its own tv channel called Al Manar, which they often use to eulogise their dead (along with their names and photographs). As for your other point about meddling with the true tally, I mean it is possible, but the disparity between the numbers sort of gives it away.',
			'Does it give it away? I mean, since no one knows the whole figure, how these things are usually called out is the fact that each death is publicly recorded. For example, for Israel, each death is written down in a monument, not to mention various other publicizations. Even if the family doesn\'t notice the various other mentionings of the soldier, their absence from the monument would be clear. Does Hezbollah have something similar--some place where all the names are placed together, which would prevent Hezbollah from being able to manipulate numbers?',

Someone on his staff suggested having the Democratic leaders over to the governor\'s mansion for dinner. The table was set for 20, but there were only around seven in attendance. One unlucky legislator stuck next to Pence tried to make conversation, but found even at dinner she couldn\'t shift Pence off his talking points. Gov. Pence shouted to his wife, Karen, his closest adviser, at the other end of the table. "Mother, Mother, who prepared our meal this evening?" The legislators looked at one another, speaking with their eyes: He just called his wife "Mother." Maybe it was a joke, the legislator reasoned. But a few minutes later, Pence shouted again. "Mother, Mother, whose china are we eating on?" Mother Pence went on a long discourse about where the china was from. A little later, the legislators stumbled out, wondering what was weirder: Pence\'s inability to make conversation, or calling his wife "Mother" in the second decade of the 21st century.  https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/the-radical-crusade-of-mike-pence-w462223',

Weird, yes, but not nearly interesting enough for it to be brought up as much as I see it mentioned. ',

			'The UN disagrees http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/14032017 Also No, Amnesty International doesn\'t accuse YPG of ethnic cleansing. It accuses YPG of displacing civilians and demolishing homes which belonged to civilians who had allegedly and directly or indirectly supported ISIS or other extremist militias. The number of destroyed houses was close to ~90*. The reasons why Amnesty International didn\'t classify acts as an ethnic cleansing: All demolished houses were not in the same village or region. Only some houses from some villages were destroyed.* Majority of houses belonged to the local Arabs but also to the Turkmens, Kurds and other minorities. YPG members who demolished houses were not only Kurds but also Arabs and Turkmens. It was clear and also Amnesty International mentioned that there were heavy battles in some investigated areas. If they would have wanted to carry out "ethnic cleansing", they would have destroyed all villages and houses. If they would have done it, they would have destroyed ~14,000 houses. No one died. YPG had already announced that displaced families (~210 family) are allowed to return. ISIS activists and Turkish nationalists have used Amnesty International\'s report as a propaganda. Also, some Turkish and Arab newspapers have deliberately used the report to tarnish YPG\'s reputation. However, neither Amnesty International nor other human rights organizations have ever accused YPG of ethnic cleansing. You can read the full report on their website at https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/2503/2015/en/ More than 1 million internally displaced people living in Kurdish areas, a.k.a Rojava. The vast majority of those IDPs are Arabs. If YPG would have wanted to carry out ethnic cleansing, they would have displaced those IDPs first. VICE NEWS decided to make a documentary about the event and travel to Turkey. They found some interviewed victims. According to the Amnesty International report, more than 32 victims were interviewed by their research workers. VICE NEWS succeeded to find some of those victims. Things that came to light after the Vice News interview: One of the "victims" was a former ISIS member. He didn\'t only admit this, but also said that he still support ISIS and wants Sharia law. Another "victim" was commander of local Turkmen militia. He represented himself as lawyer of Tel Abyad Council. He was wanted by local YPG and SAA authorities and wait, you\'re gonna love this: He was accused of forced recruitment and two murder attempts. Some victims said, as you can see from the documentary, they prefer rather ISIS than the Kurds. Take into account, they said the Kurds, not YPG or Kurdish militia and by saying this, it was clear who they really are. They also said they want Sharia and that is something which is against Rojava’s direct democracy.',

Lots of men were hanged for providing logistical support, not actually fighting. I don\'t see people arguing that they should be brought back to be tried in their home countries. Why are women special? Besides, pretty much every country has different rules in wartime. Providing aid and comfort to the enemy is punishable by death during wartime in most western countries as well. The fact is that these people, both men and women, renounced their own countries when they ran off to join ISIS. They were in a war with Iraq and Syria, and now they\'re answering for their crimes in Iraqi and Syrian courts. There\'s no reason for Britain or France or wherever they came from to be involved.',
			'That\'s what I\'m saying. My comment was in response to the one saying to just hang them cause they went to join ISIS. They shouldn\'t be hung just for running off to marry murders. They should be trialed for actual crimes they commit. Perhaps people are just sensitive to anything ISIS related and want to purge them all regardless of what they did. I still think the rule of law should prevail instead of blind retribution. After all, we are not the same as ISIS. ',
			'ockquote> I still think the rule of law should prevail instead of blind retribution. After all, we are not the same as ISIS.   They\'re not being lynched, they\'re being prosecuted for their crimes in courts of law. This IS the rule of law prevailing. Otherwise they\'d have been strung up from the nearest tree when they were caught. The entire story is about who has legal jurisdiction. Some people are saying that people against whom the crimes were committed have jurisdiction, their courts should try these people. Others are saying bring them back to Europe where most countries have abolished the death penalty, and where there are no witnesses against their crimes anyway, because the people they murdered or their relatives are all back in Iraq or Syria. What would you even try them for in Britain? For running off to join ISIS, give them a few years in prison? The people who actually witnessed the crimes, whose husbands and fathers and relatives were murdered by ISIS are still in Iraq and Syria. You\'d be removing the victims from the equation, writing off their deaths, if you were to try these people in Europe. The guy you responded to wasn\'t asking "death for all". He said that IF you voluntarily joined ISIS, you should be punished, with the punishment to be decided by Iraqi or Syrian courts. This is justice. Joining ISIS is a crime in itself. It\'s an organization that has massacred thousands, practiced slavery, bought and sold Yazidi women, tortured, launched terrorist attacks against other countries. Joining such an organization absolutely deserves punishment. What that punishment will be is up to the courts. They are not a lynch mob, they have already freed women who were coerced into joining ISIS by their husbands. So far the only women they have sentenced to hang are those who actively helped ISIS. Let them do their job.',
			'Spouses of SS officers unpunished. Well look at the guy that failed history.  And about guilty or not, try proving it after they get home. Just deny deny deny and back to welfare because surprise surprise they are widowed. There is a difference between not guilty due to lack of evidence and proving innocence. Unless proven 100% innocent we should not be asked to take the risk. And if found guilty we can now pay for their rehabilitation and state mandated housing and then they get out in 5-12 years to go blow some bombs. There is way way too much risk involved.',

According to western laws, that is dangerously close to hatespeech territory already. They know they should not, and do so anyway. And their little muslim cliques all reinforce these ideas and their little echochamber gets them to the point of martyrdom for the glorious jihad. And somehow western citizens are responsible because we raised them? Hell no. They were trash alright, I will agree with that one.

And regardless of whether a suitable family member is available or not. Every one of these children should be considered a high risk for radicalization.  The only way to get these children away from their mothers and other radicalized influences is to extradite the mothers immediately and to bring the children with them.  If we get all the children away from radicalizing forces and the consequence is a shorter sentence for the mother, I’m really ok with that. ',

There would be nothing to stop them from returning to these countries after being radicalized to radicalize others or to engage in terrorist acts.

Thankfully not many of you exist here in the Republic or in the North. edit: for context:  In 1994, talks between the leaders of the two main Irish nationalist parties in Northern Ireland, John Hume of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), and Gerry Adams of Sinn Féin (SF), continued. These talks led to a series of joint statements on how the violence might be brought to an end. The talks had been going on since the late 1980s and had secured the backing of the Irish Government through an intermediary, Father Alec Reid.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland_peace_process',

North Korea has a population of 25 mil. The regime has been in power since the late 40s. They would have run out of people to kill decades ago if they were killing anything close to that number of people.',

Obviously you seem to think that this is the reality in North Korea. The best way to educate you on the subject is simply to ask for citation - which is what I am going to do  thousands of people die every day in work camps.  Citation needed. Hopefully you learn something. Downvote all you want, you know I\'m right.',
